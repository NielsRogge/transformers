# Semantic segmentation example

This directory contains a script, `run_semantic_segmentation_no_trainer.py`, that showcases how to fine-tune any `AutoModelForSemanticSegmentation` (such as SegFormer, BEiT, DPT) for semantic segmentation using PyTorch.

The script leverages [ðŸ¤— `Accelerate`](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate), which allows to write your own training loop in PyTorch, but have it run instantly on any (distributed) environment, including CPU, multi-CPU, GPU, multi-GPU and TPU. It also supports mixed precision. 

First, run:

```bash
accelerate config
```

and reply to the questions asked regarding the environment on which you'd like to train. Then:

```bash
accelerate launch run_semantic_segmentation_no_trainer.py 
```

and boom, you're training, possible on multiple GPUs :)

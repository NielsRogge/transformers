    r"""
    Performs non-maximum suppression (NMS) in a batched fashion.

    Modified from [torchvision/ops/boxes.py#L39](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/
    505cd6957711af790211896d32b40291bea1bc21/torchvision/ops/boxes.py#L39). In order to perform NMS independently per
    class, we add an offset to all the boxes. The offset is dependent only on the class idx, and is large enough so
    that boxes from different classes do not overlap.

    Note: skipping the NMS is also supported and returns sorted raw results when `nms_cfg` is None.

    Args:
        boxes (`torch.Tensor`):
            Bounding boxes in shape (N, 4) or (N, 5) with N = number of objects.
        scores (`torch.Tensor`):
            Scores in shape (N,).
        idxs (`torch.Tensor`):
            Each index value corresponds to a bbox cluster, and NMS will not be applied between elements of different
            idxs, shape (N, ).
        nms_cfg (`dict`, *optional*):
            Supports skipping the nms when *nms_cfg* is None, otherwise it should specify nms type and other parameters
            like *iou_thr*. Possible keys includes the following.
            - iou_threshold (float): IoU threshold used for NMS.
            - split_threshold (float): threshold number of boxes. In some cases the number of boxes is large (e.g.,
              200k). To avoid OOM during training, the users could set *split_threshold* to a small value. If the
              number of boxes is greater than the threshold, it will perform NMS on each group of boxes separately and
              sequentially. Defaults to 10000.
        class_agnostic (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            If `True`, NMS is class agnostic, i.e. IoU thresholding happens over all boxes, regardless of the predicted
            class.

    Returns:
        `Tuple(torch.Tensor)` comprising various elements:
        - **boxes** (`torch.Tensor`):
            Bboxes with scores after NMS, has shape (num_bboxes, 5). Last dimension 5 arranges as (x1, y1, x2, y2,
            score).
        - **keep** (`torch.Tensor`):
            The indices of remaining boxes in the input boxes.

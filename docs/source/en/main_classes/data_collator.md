# Data Collator

Data collators are objects that will form a batch by using a list of dataset elements as input. These elements are of
the same type as the elements of `train_dataset` or `eval_dataset`.

To be able to build batches, data collators may apply some processing (like padding). Some of them (like
[`DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`]) also apply some random data augmentation (like random masking)
on the formed batch.

Examples of use can be found in the [example scripts](../examples) or [example notebooks](../notebooks).


## Default data collator

data.data_collator.default_data_collator

    Very simple data collator that simply collates batches of dict-like objects and performs special handling for
    potential keys named:

        - `label`: handles a single value (int or float) per object
        - `label_ids`: handles a list of values per object

    Does not do any additional preprocessing: property names of the input object will be used as corresponding inputs
    to the model. See glue and ner for example of how it's useful.
    

## DefaultDataCollator

data.data_collator.DefaultDataCollator

    Very simple data collator that simply collates batches of dict-like objects and performs special handling for
    potential keys named:

        - `label`: handles a single value (int or float) per object
        - `label_ids`: handles a list of values per object

    Does not do any additional preprocessing: property names of the input object will be used as corresponding inputs
    to the model. See glue and ner for example of how it's useful.

    This is an object (like other data collators) rather than a pure function like default_data_collator. This can be
    helpful if you need to set a return_tensors value at initialization.

    Args:
        return_tensors (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"pt"`):
            The type of Tensor to return. Allowable values are "np", "pt" and "tf".
    

## DataCollatorWithPadding

data.data_collator.DataCollatorWithPadding

    Data collator that will dynamically pad the inputs received.

    Args:
        tokenizer ([`PreTrainedTokenizer`] or [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`]):
            The tokenizer used for encoding the data.
        padding (`bool`, `str` or [`~utils.PaddingStrategy`], *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding index)
            among:

            - `True` or `'longest'` (default): Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
              sequence is provided).
            - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
              acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
            - `False` or `'do_not_pad'`: No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of different lengths).
        max_length (`int`, *optional*):
            Maximum length of the returned list and optionally padding length (see above).
        pad_to_multiple_of (`int`, *optional*):
            If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

            This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability >=
            7.0 (Volta).
        return_tensors (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"pt"`):
            The type of Tensor to return. Allowable values are "np", "pt" and "tf".

            The tokenizer used for encoding the data.
        padding (`bool`, `str` or [`~utils.PaddingStrategy`], *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding index)
            among:

            - `True` or `'longest'` (default): Pad to the longest sequence in the batch (or no padding if only a single
              sequence is provided).
            - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
              acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.
            - `False` or `'do_not_pad'`: No padding (i.e., can output a batch with sequences of different lengths).

        pad_to_multiple_of (`int`, *optional*):
            If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

            This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability >=
            7.0 (Volta).
        label_pad_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to -100):
            The id to use when padding the labels (-100 will be automatically ignore by PyTorch loss functions).
        return_tensors (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"pt"`):
            The type of Tensor to return. Allowable values are "np", "pt" and "tf".

        tokenizer ([`PreTrainedTokenizer`] or [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`]):
            The tokenizer used for encoding the data.
        model ([`PreTrainedModel`], *optional*):
            The model that is being trained. If set and has the *prepare_decoder_input_ids_from_labels*, use it to
            prepare the *decoder_input_ids*

            This is useful when using *label_smoothing* to avoid calculating loss twice.
        padding (`bool`, `str` or [`~utils.PaddingStrategy`], *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Select a strategy to pad the returned sequences (according to the model's padding side and padding index)
            among:

              sequence is provided).
            - `'max_length'`: Pad to a maximum length specified with the argument `max_length` or to the maximum
              acceptable input length for the model if that argument is not provided.

        label_pad_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to -100):
            The id to use when padding the labels (-100 will be automatically ignored by PyTorch loss functions).
        return_tensors (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"pt"`):
            The type of Tensor to return. Allowable values are "np", "pt" and "tf".
    

## DataCollatorForLanguageModeling

data.data_collator.DataCollatorForLanguageModeling

    Data collator used for language modeling. Inputs are dynamically padded to the maximum length of a batch if they
    are not all of the same length.

    Args:
        tokenizer ([`PreTrainedTokenizer`] or [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`]):
            The tokenizer used for encoding the data.
        mlm (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to use masked language modeling. If set to `False`, the labels are the same as the inputs
            with the padding tokens ignored (by setting them to -100). Otherwise, the labels are -100 for non-masked
            tokens and the value to predict for the masked token.
        mlm_probability (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.15):
            The probability with which to (randomly) mask tokens in the input, when `mlm` is set to `True`.
        pad_to_multiple_of (`int`, *optional*):
            If set will pad the sequence to a multiple of the provided value.

            This is especially useful to enable the use of Tensor Cores on NVIDIA hardware with compute capability >=
            7.0 (Volta).
        return_tensors (`str`):
            The type of Tensor to return. Allowable values are "np", "pt" and "tf".

    <Tip>

    For best performance, this data collator should be used with a dataset having items that are dictionaries or
    BatchEncoding, with the `"special_tokens_mask"` key, as returned by a [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] or a
    [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] with the argument `return_special_tokens_mask=True`.

    - tf_mask_tokens
    - torch_mask_tokens

## DataCollatorForWholeWordMask

data.data_collator.DataCollatorForWholeWordMask

    Data collator used for language modeling that masks entire words.

    - collates batches of tensors, honoring their tokenizer's pad_token
    - preprocesses batches for masked language modeling

    <Tip>

    This collator relies on details of the implementation of subword tokenization by [`BertTokenizer`], specifically
    that subword tokens are prefixed with *##*. For tokenizers that do not adhere to this scheme, this collator will
    produce an output that is roughly equivalent to [`.DataCollatorForLanguageModeling`].

    - tf_mask_tokens
    - torch_mask_tokens

## DataCollatorForPermutationLanguageModeling

data.data_collator.DataCollatorForPermutationLanguageModeling

    Data collator used for permutation language modeling.

    - collates batches of tensors, honoring their tokenizer's pad_token
    - preprocesses batches for permutation language modeling with procedures specific to XLNet
    
    - numpy_mask_tokens
    - tf_mask_tokens
    - torch_mask_tokens

## DataCollatorWithFlattening

data.data_collator.DataCollatorWithFlattening

    Data collator used for padding free approach. Does the following:

    - concatate the entire mini batch into single long sequence [1, total_tokens]
    - uses `separator_id` to separate sequences within the concatenated `labels`, default value is -100
    - no padding will be added, returns `input_ids`, `labels` and `position_ids`

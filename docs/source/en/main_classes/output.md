# Model outputs

All models have outputs that are instances of subclasses of [`~utils.ModelOutput`]. Those are
data structures containing all the information returned by the model, but that can also be used as tuples or
dictionaries.

Let's see how this looks in an example:

```python
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
import torch

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-uncased")
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("google-bert/bert-base-uncased")

inputs = tokenizer("Hello, my dog is cute", return_tensors="pt")
labels = torch.tensor([1]).unsqueeze(0)  # Batch size 1
outputs = model(**inputs, labels=labels)
```

The `outputs` object is a [`~modeling_outputs.SequenceClassifierOutput`], as we can see in the
documentation of that class below, it means it has an optional `loss`, a `logits`, an optional `hidden_states` and
an optional `attentions` attribute. Here we have the `loss` since we passed along `labels`, but we don't have
`hidden_states` and `attentions` because we didn't pass `output_hidden_states=True` or
`output_attentions=True`.

<Tip>

When passing `output_hidden_states=True` you may expect the `outputs.hidden_states[-1]` to match `outputs.last_hidden_state` exactly.
However, this is not always the case. Some models apply normalization or subsequent process to the last hidden state when it's returned.

</Tip>


You can access each attribute as you would usually do, and if that attribute has not been returned by the model, you
will get `None`. Here for instance `outputs.loss` is the loss computed by the model, and `outputs.attentions` is
`None`.

When considering our `outputs` object as tuple, it only considers the attributes that don't have `None` values.
Here for instance, it has two elements, `loss` then `logits`, so

```python
outputs[:2]
```

will return the tuple `(outputs.loss, outputs.logits)` for instance.

When considering our `outputs` object as dictionary, it only considers the attributes that don't have `None`
values. Here for instance, it has two keys that are `loss` and `logits`.

We document here the generic model outputs that are used by more than one model type. Specific output types are
documented on their corresponding model page.

## ModelOutput

utils.ModelOutput

    Base class for all model outputs as dataclass. Has a `__getitem__` that allows indexing by integer or slice (like a
    tuple) or strings (like a dictionary) that will ignore the `None` attributes. Otherwise behaves like a regular
    python dictionary.

    <Tip warning={true}>

    You can't unpack a `ModelOutput` directly. Use the [`~utils.ModelOutput.to_tuple`] method to convert it to a tuple
    before.

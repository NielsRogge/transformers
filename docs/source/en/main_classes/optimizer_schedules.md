# Optimization

The `.optimization` module provides:

- an optimizer with weight decay fixed that can be used to fine-tuned models, and
- several schedules in the form of schedule objects that inherit from `_LRSchedule`:
- a gradient accumulation class to accumulate the gradients of multiple batches

## AdamW (PyTorch)


    Implements Adam algorithm with weight decay fix as introduced in [Decoupled Weight Decay
    Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05101).

    Parameters:
        params (`Iterable[nn.parameter.Parameter]`):
            Iterable of parameters to optimize or dictionaries defining parameter groups.
        lr (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.001):
            The learning rate to use.
        betas (`Tuple[float,float]`, *optional*, defaults to `(0.9, 0.999)`):
            Adam's betas parameters (b1, b2).
        eps (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1e-06):
            Adam's epsilon for numerical stability.
        weight_decay (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            Decoupled weight decay to apply.
        correct_bias (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to correct bias in Adam (for instance, in Bert TF repository they use `False`).
        no_deprecation_warning (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            A flag used to disable the deprecation warning (set to `True` to disable the warning).
    

## AdaFactor (PyTorch)


    AdaFactor pytorch implementation can be used as a drop in replacement for Adam original fairseq code:
    https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/master/fairseq/optim/adafactor.py

    Paper: *Adafactor: Adaptive Learning Rates with Sublinear Memory Cost* https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04235 Note that
    this optimizer internally adjusts the learning rate depending on the `scale_parameter`, `relative_step` and
    `warmup_init` options. To use a manual (external) learning rate schedule you should set `scale_parameter=False` and
    `relative_step=False`.

    Arguments:
        params (`Iterable[nn.parameter.Parameter]`):
            Iterable of parameters to optimize or dictionaries defining parameter groups.
        lr (`float`, *optional*):
            The external learning rate.
        eps (`Tuple[float, float]`, *optional*, defaults to `(1e-30, 0.001)`):
            Regularization constants for square gradient and parameter scale respectively
        clip_threshold (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0):
            Threshold of root mean square of final gradient update
        decay_rate (`float`, *optional*, defaults to -0.8):
            Coefficient used to compute running averages of square
        beta1 (`float`, *optional*):
            Coefficient used for computing running averages of gradient
        weight_decay (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            Weight decay (L2 penalty)
        scale_parameter (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            If True, learning rate is scaled by root mean square
        relative_step (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            If True, time-dependent learning rate is computed instead of external learning rate
        warmup_init (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Time-dependent learning rate computation depends on whether warm-up initialization is being used

    This implementation handles low-precision (FP16, bfloat) values, but we have not thoroughly tested.

    Recommended T5 finetuning settings (https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/t5-finetuning-tips/684/3):

        - Training without LR warmup or clip_threshold is not recommended.

           - use scheduled LR warm-up to fixed LR
           - use clip_threshold=1.0 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.04235)
        - Disable relative updates
        - Use scale_parameter=False
        - Additional optimizer operations like gradient clipping should not be used alongside Adafactor

    Example:

    ```python
    Adafactor(model.parameters(), scale_parameter=False, relative_step=False, warmup_init=False, lr=1e-3)
    ```

    Others reported the following combination to work well:

    ```python
    Adafactor(model.parameters(), scale_parameter=True, relative_step=True, warmup_init=True, lr=None)
    ```

    When using `lr=None` with [`Trainer`] you will most likely need to use [`~optimization.AdafactorSchedule`]
    scheduler as following:

    ```python
    from transformers.optimization import Adafactor, AdafactorSchedule

    optimizer = Adafactor(model.parameters(), scale_parameter=True, relative_step=True, warmup_init=True, lr=None)
    lr_scheduler = AdafactorSchedule(optimizer)
    trainer = Trainer(..., optimizers=(optimizer, lr_scheduler))
    ```

    Usage:

    ```python
    # replace AdamW with Adafactor
    optimizer = Adafactor(
        model.parameters(),
        lr=1e-3,
        eps=(1e-30, 1e-3),
        clip_threshold=1.0,
        decay_rate=-0.8,
        beta1=None,
        weight_decay=0.0,
        relative_step=False,
        scale_parameter=False,
        warmup_init=False,
    )
    ```

            Adam's epsilon for numerical stability.

            Decoupled weight decay to apply.

## Schedules

### Learning Rate Schedules (PyTorch)


    Scheduler names for the parameter `lr_scheduler_type` in [`TrainingArguments`].
    By default, it uses "linear". Internally, this retrieves `get_linear_schedule_with_warmup` scheduler from [`Trainer`].
    Scheduler types:
       - "linear" = get_linear_schedule_with_warmup
       - "cosine" = get_cosine_schedule_with_warmup
       - "cosine_with_restarts" = get_cosine_with_hard_restarts_schedule_with_warmup
       - "polynomial" = get_polynomial_decay_schedule_with_warmup
       - "constant" =  get_constant_schedule
       - "constant_with_warmup" = get_constant_schedule_with_warmup
       - "inverse_sqrt" = get_inverse_sqrt_schedule
       - "reduce_lr_on_plateau" = get_reduce_on_plateau_schedule
       - "cosine_with_min_lr" = get_cosine_with_min_lr_schedule_with_warmup
       - "warmup_stable_decay" = get_wsd_schedule
    


    Unified API to get any scheduler from its name.

    Args:
        name (`str` or `SchedulerType`):
            The name of the scheduler to use.
        optimizer (`torch.optim.Optimizer`):
            The optimizer that will be used during training.
        num_warmup_steps (`int`, *optional*):
            The number of warmup steps to do. This is not required by all schedulers (hence the argument being
            optional), the function will raise an error if it's unset and the scheduler type requires it.
        num_training_steps (`int``, *optional*):
            The number of training steps to do. This is not required by all schedulers (hence the argument being
            optional), the function will raise an error if it's unset and the scheduler type requires it.
        scheduler_specific_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*):
            Extra parameters for schedulers such as cosine with restarts. Mismatched scheduler types and scheduler
            parameters will cause the scheduler function to raise a TypeError.

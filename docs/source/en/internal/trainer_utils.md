# Utilities for Trainer

This page lists all the utility functions used by [`Trainer`].

Most of those are only useful if you are studying the code of the Trainer in the library.

## Utilities


    Evaluation output (always contains labels), to be used to compute metrics.

    Parameters:
        predictions (`np.ndarray`): Predictions of the model.
        label_ids (`np.ndarray`): Targets to be matched.
        inputs (`np.ndarray`, *optional*): Input data passed to the model.
        losses (`np.ndarray`, *optional*): Loss values computed during evaluation.
    

[[autodoc]] IntervalStrategy


    Helper function for reproducible behavior during distributed training. See
    - https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html for pytorch
    - https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/config/experimental/enable_op_determinism for tensorflow
    


    Helper function for reproducible behavior to set the seed in `random`, `numpy`, `torch` and/or `tf` (if installed).

    Args:
        seed (`int`):
            The seed to set.
        deterministic (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use deterministic algorithms where available. Can slow down training.
    


    Decorator to make all processes in distributed training wait for each local_master to do something.

    Args:
        local_rank (`int`): The rank of the local process.
    

## Callbacks internals

[[autodoc]] trainer_callback.CallbackHandler

## Distributed Evaluation

[[autodoc]] trainer_pt_utils.DistributedTensorGatherer

## Trainer Argument Parser


    This subclass of `argparse.ArgumentParser` uses type hints on dataclasses to generate arguments.

    The class is designed to play well with the native argparse. In particular, you can add more (non-dataclass backed)
    arguments to the parser after initialization and you'll get the output back after parsing as an additional
    namespace. Optional: To create sub argument groups use the `_argument_group_name` attribute in the dataclass.

## Overview

The XLM-RoBERTa model was proposed in [Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116) by Alexis Conneau, Kartikay Khandelwal, Naman Goyal, Vishrav Chaudhary, Guillaume
Wenzek, Francisco Guzmán, Edouard Grave, Myle Ott, Luke Zettlemoyer and Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Facebook's
RoBERTa model released in 2019. It is a large multi-lingual language model, trained on 2.5TB of filtered CommonCrawl
data.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*This paper shows that pretraining multilingual language models at scale leads to significant performance gains for a
wide range of cross-lingual transfer tasks. We train a Transformer-based masked language model on one hundred
languages, using more than two terabytes of filtered CommonCrawl data. Our model, dubbed XLM-R, significantly
outperforms multilingual BERT (mBERT) on a variety of cross-lingual benchmarks, including +13.8% average accuracy on
XNLI, +12.3% average F1 score on MLQA, and +2.1% average F1 score on NER. XLM-R performs particularly well on
low-resource languages, improving 11.8% in XNLI accuracy for Swahili and 9.2% for Urdu over the previous XLM model. We
also present a detailed empirical evaluation of the key factors that are required to achieve these gains, including the
trade-offs between (1) positive transfer and capacity dilution and (2) the performance of high and low resource
languages at scale. Finally, we show, for the first time, the possibility of multilingual modeling without sacrificing
per-language performance; XLM-R is very competitive with strong monolingual models on the GLUE and XNLI benchmarks. We
will make XLM-R code, data, and models publicly available.*

This model was contributed by [stefan-it](https://huggingface.co/stefan-it). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/xlmr).

## Usage tips

- XLM-RoBERTa is a multilingual model trained on 100 different languages. Unlike some XLM multilingual models, it does
  not require `lang` tensors to understand which language is used, and should be able to determine the correct
  language from the input ids.
- Uses RoBERTa tricks on the XLM approach, but does not use the translation language modeling objective. It only uses masked language modeling on sentences coming from one language.

## XLMRobertaConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`XLMRobertaModel`] or a [`TFXLMRobertaModel`]. It
    is used to instantiate a XLM-RoBERTa model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
    Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the XLMRoBERTa
    [FacebookAI/xlm-roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/xlm-roberta-base) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## XLMRobertaTokenizer


    Adapted from [`RobertaTokenizer`] and [`XLNetTokenizer`]. Based on
    [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
            sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

            </Tip>

        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.
            The token used is the `sep_token`.

            </Tip>

        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<mask>"`):

        sp_model_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*):
            Will be passed to the `SentencePieceProcessor.__init__()` method. The [Python wrapper for
            SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/tree/master/python) can be used, among other things,
            to set:

            - `enable_sampling`: Enable subword regularization.
            - `nbest_size`: Sampling parameters for unigram. Invalid for BPE-Dropout.

              - `nbest_size = {0,1}`: No sampling is performed.
              - `nbest_size > 1`: samples from the nbest_size results.
              - `nbest_size < 0`: assuming that nbest_size is infinite and samples from the all hypothesis (lattice)
                using forward-filtering-and-backward-sampling algorithm.

            - `alpha`: Smoothing parameter for unigram sampling, and dropout probability of merge operations for
              BPE-dropout.

    Attributes:
        sp_model (`SentencePieceProcessor`):
            The *SentencePiece* processor that is used for every conversion (string, tokens and IDs).

## XLMRobertaModel

The bare XLM-RoBERTa Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`XLMRobertaConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.


    The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
    cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
    all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
    Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

    To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set
    to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and
    `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

    XLM-RoBERTa Model with a token classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output) e.g.
    for Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) tasks.
    

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`XLMRobertaConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

## XLMRobertaForQuestionAnswering


    XLM-RoBERTa Model with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like SQuAD (a
    linear layers on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).
    

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`XLMRobertaConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

## Overview

The Bart model was proposed in [BART: Denoising Sequence-to-Sequence Pre-training for Natural Language Generation,
Translation, and Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461) by Mike Lewis, Yinhan Liu, Naman Goyal, Marjan
Ghazvininejad, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Omer Levy, Ves Stoyanov and Luke Zettlemoyer on 29 Oct, 2019.

According to the abstract,

- Bart uses a standard seq2seq/machine translation architecture with a bidirectional encoder (like BERT) and a
  left-to-right decoder (like GPT).
- The pretraining task involves randomly shuffling the order of the original sentences and a novel in-filling scheme,
  where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token.
- BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It
  matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE and SQuAD, achieves new
  state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains
  of up to 6 ROUGE.

This model was contributed by [sshleifer](https://huggingface.co/sshleifer). The authors' code can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/bart).

## Usage tips:

- BART is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than
  the left.
- Sequence-to-sequence model with an encoder and a decoder. Encoder is fed a corrupted version of the tokens, decoder is fed the original tokens (but has a mask to hide the future words like a regular transformers decoder). A composition of the following transformations are applied on the pretraining tasks for the encoder:

  * mask random tokens (like in BERT)
  * delete random tokens
  * mask a span of k tokens with a single mask token (a span of 0 tokens is an insertion of a mask token)
  * permute sentences
  * rotate the document to make it start at a specific token

## Implementation Notes

- Bart doesn't use `token_type_ids` for sequence classification. Use [`BartTokenizer`] or
  [`~BartTokenizer.encode`] to get the proper splitting.
- The forward pass of [`BartModel`] will create the `decoder_input_ids` if they are not passed.
  This is different than some other modeling APIs. A typical use case of this feature is mask filling.
- Model predictions are intended to be identical to the original implementation when
  `forced_bos_token_id=0`. This only works, however, if the string you pass to
  [`fairseq.encode`] starts with a space.
- [`~generation.GenerationMixin.generate`] should be used for conditional generation tasks like
  summarization, see the example in that docstrings.
- Models that load the *facebook/bart-large-cnn* weights will not have a `mask_token_id`, or be able to perform
  mask-filling tasks.

## Mask Filling

The `facebook/bart-base` and `facebook/bart-large` checkpoints can be used to fill multi-token masks.

```python
from transformers import BartForConditionalGeneration, BartTokenizer

model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("facebook/bart-large", forced_bos_token_id=0)
tok = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/bart-large")
example_english_phrase = "UN Chief Says There Is No <mask> in Syria"
batch = tok(example_english_phrase, return_tensors="pt")
generated_ids = model.generate(batch["input_ids"])
assert tok.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True) == [
    "UN Chief Says There Is No Plan to Stop Chemical Weapons in Syria"
]
```

Methods: all

## BartTokenizer


    Constructs a BART tokenizer, which is smilar to the ROBERTa tokenizer, using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will
    be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import BartTokenizer

    >>> tokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/bart-base")
    >>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 31414, 232, 2]

    >>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 20920, 232, 2]
    ```

    You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
    call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

    <Tip>

    When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer will add a space before each word (even the first one).

    </Tip>

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            Path to the vocabulary file.
        merges_file (`str`):
            Path to the merges file.
        errors (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"replace"`):
            Paradigm to follow when decoding bytes to UTF-8. See
            [bytes.decode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode) for more information.
        bos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
            sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

            </Tip>

        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.
            The token used is the `sep_token`.

            </Tip>

        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<mask>"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
        add_prefix_space (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add an initial space to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as any
            other word. (BART tokenizer detect beginning of words by the preceding space).
    

Methods: all

## BartTokenizerFast


    Construct a "fast" BART tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's *tokenizers* library), derived from the GPT-2 tokenizer,
    using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will
    be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import BartTokenizerFast

    >>> tokenizer = BartTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("facebook/bart-base")
    >>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 31414, 232, 2]

    >>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 20920, 232, 2]
    ```

    You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
    call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

    <Tip>

    When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer needs to be instantiated with `add_prefix_space=True`.

    </Tip>

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should
    refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`BartConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

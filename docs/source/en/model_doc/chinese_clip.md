# Chinese-CLIP

## Overview

The Chinese-CLIP model was proposed in [Chinese CLIP: Contrastive Vision-Language Pretraining in Chinese](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01335) by An Yang, Junshu Pan, Junyang Lin, Rui Men, Yichang Zhang, Jingren Zhou, Chang Zhou.
Chinese-CLIP is an implementation of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) on a large-scale dataset of Chinese image-text pairs. It is capable of performing cross-modal retrieval and also playing as a vision backbone for vision tasks like zero-shot image classification, open-domain object detection, etc. The original Chinese-CLIP code is released [at this link](https://github.com/OFA-Sys/Chinese-CLIP).

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*The tremendous success of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) has promoted the research and application of contrastive learning for vision-language pretraining. In this work, we construct a large-scale dataset of image-text pairs in Chinese, where most data are retrieved from publicly available datasets, and we pretrain Chinese CLIP models on the new dataset. We develop 5 Chinese CLIP models of multiple sizes, spanning from 77 to 958 million parameters. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage pretraining method, where the model is first trained with the image encoder frozen and then trained with all parameters being optimized, to achieve enhanced model performance. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Chinese CLIP can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on MUGE, Flickr30K-CN, and COCO-CN in the setups of zero-shot learning and finetuning, and it is able to achieve competitive performance in zero-shot image classification based on the evaluation on the ELEVATER benchmark (Li et al., 2022). Our codes, pretrained models, and demos have been released.*

The Chinese-CLIP model was contributed by [OFA-Sys](https://huggingface.co/OFA-Sys).

## Usage example

The code snippet below shows how to compute image & text features and similarities:

```python
>>> from PIL import Image
>>> import requests
>>> from transformers import ChineseCLIPProcessor, ChineseCLIPModel

>>> model = ChineseCLIPModel.from_pretrained("OFA-Sys/chinese-clip-vit-base-patch16")
>>> processor = ChineseCLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("OFA-Sys/chinese-clip-vit-base-patch16")

>>> url = "https://clip-cn-beijing.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/pokemon.jpeg"
>>> image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)
>>> # Squirtle, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Pikachu in English
>>> texts = ["杰尼龟", "妙蛙种子", "小火龙", "皮卡丘"]

>>> # compute image feature
>>> inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
>>> image_features = model.get_image_features(**inputs)
>>> image_features = image_features / image_features.norm(p=2, dim=-1, keepdim=True)  # normalize

>>> # compute text features
>>> inputs = processor(text=texts, padding=True, return_tensors="pt")
>>> text_features = model.get_text_features(**inputs)
>>> text_features = text_features / text_features.norm(p=2, dim=-1, keepdim=True)  # normalize

>>> # compute image-text similarity scores
>>> inputs = processor(text=texts, images=image, return_tensors="pt", padding=True)
>>> outputs = model(**inputs)
>>> logits_per_image = outputs.logits_per_image  # this is the image-text similarity score
>>> probs = logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)  # probs: [[1.2686e-03, 5.4499e-02, 6.7968e-04, 9.4355e-01]]

## ChineseCLIPConfig


    [`ChineseCLIPConfig`] is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`ChineseCLIPModel`]. It is used
    to instantiate Chinese-CLIP model according to the specified arguments, defining the text model and vision model

    Chinese-CLIP [OFA-Sys/chinese-clip-vit-base-patch16](https://huggingface.co/OFA-Sys/chinese-clip-vit-base-patch16)
    architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    >>> model = ChineseCLIPModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config

    >>> # We can also initialize a ChineseCLIPConfig from a ChineseCLIPTextConfig and a ChineseCLIPVisionConfig

    >>> # Initializing a ChineseCLIPTextConfig and ChineseCLIPVisionConfig configuration

## ChineseCLIPFeatureExtractor

No docstring available for ChineseCLIPFeatureExtractor

    Constructs a Chinese-CLIP processor which wraps a Chinese-CLIP image processor and a Chinese-CLIP tokenizer into a
    single processor.

    [`ChineseCLIPProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`ChineseCLIPImageProcessor`] and [`BertTokenizerFast`].
    See the [`~ChineseCLIPProcessor.__call__`] and [`~ChineseCLIPProcessor.decode`] for more information.

    Args:
        image_processor ([`ChineseCLIPImageProcessor`], *optional*):
            The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer ([`BertTokenizerFast`], *optional*):
            The tokenizer is a required input.
    

## ChineseCLIPModel


    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it
    as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`ChineseCLIPConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.


Methods: forward
    - get_text_features
    - get_image_features

## ChineseCLIPTextModel

The text model from CHINESE_CLIP without any head or projection on top.
    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it
    as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`ChineseCLIPConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.


    The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
    cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
    all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
    Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

    To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set
    to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and
    `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

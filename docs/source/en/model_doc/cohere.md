# Cohere

## Overview

The Cohere Command-R model was proposed in the blogpost [Command-R: Retrieval Augmented Generation at Production Scale](https://txt.cohere.com/command-r/) by the Cohere Team.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Command-R is a scalable generative model targeting RAG and Tool Use to enable production-scale AI for enterprise. Today, we are introducing Command-R, a new LLM aimed at large-scale production workloads. Command-R targets the emerging ‚Äúscalable‚Äù category of models that balance high efficiency with strong accuracy, enabling companies to move beyond proof of concept, and into production.*

*Command-R is a generative model optimized for long context tasks such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and using external APIs and tools. It is designed to work in concert with our industry-leading Embed and Rerank models to provide best-in-class integration for RAG applications and excel at enterprise use cases. As a model built for companies to implement at scale, Command-R boasts:
- Strong accuracy on RAG and Tool Use
- Low latency, and high throughput
- Longer 128k context and lower pricing
- Strong capabilities across 10 key languages
- Model weights available on HuggingFace for research and evaluation

Checkout model checkpoints [here](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01).
This model was contributed by [Saurabh Dash](https://huggingface.co/saurabhdash) and [Ahmet √úst√ºn](https://huggingface.co/ahmetustun). The code of the implementation in Hugging Face is based on GPT-NeoX [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox).

## Usage tips

<Tip warning={true}>

The checkpoints uploaded on the Hub use `torch_dtype = 'float16'`, which will be
used by the `AutoModel` API to cast the checkpoints from `torch.float32` to `torch.float16`. 

The `dtype` of the online weights is mostly irrelevant unless you are using `torch_dtype="auto"` when initializing a model using `model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path", torch_dtype = "auto")`. The reason is that the model will first be downloaded ( using the `dtype` of the checkpoints online), then it will be casted to the default `dtype` of `torch` (becomes `torch.float32`), and finally, if there is a `torch_dtype` provided in the config, it will be used. 

Training the model in `float16` is not recommended and is known to produce `nan`; as such, the model should be trained in `bfloat16`.

</Tip>
The model and tokenizer can be loaded via:

```python
# pip install transformers
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

model_id = "CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)

# Format message with the command-r chat template
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}]
input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt")
## <BOS_TOKEN><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|USER_TOKEN|>Hello, how are you?<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>

gen_tokens = model.generate(
    input_ids, 
    max_new_tokens=100, 
    do_sample=True, 
    temperature=0.3,
    )

gen_text = tokenizer.decode(gen_tokens[0])
print(gen_text)
```

- When using Flash Attention 2 via `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"`, don't pass `torch_dtype` to the `from_pretrained` class method and use Automatic Mixed-Precision training. When using `Trainer`, it is simply specifying either `fp16` or `bf16` to `True`. Otherwise, make sure you are using `torch.autocast`. This is required because the Flash Attention only support `fp16` and `bf16` data type.

## CohereConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`CohereModel`]. It is used to instantiate an Cohere
    model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the [CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01](https://huggingface.co/CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01) model.


    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 256000):
            Vocabulary size of the Cohere model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`CohereModel`]

            Dimension of the hidden representations.
        intermediate_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 22528):
            Dimension of the MLP representations.
        logit_scale (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0625):

        num_key_value_heads (`int`, *optional*):
            This is the number of key_value heads that should be used to implement Grouped Query Attention. If
            `num_key_value_heads=num_attention_heads`, the model will use Multi Head Attention (MHA), if
            `num_key_value_heads=1` the model will use Multi Query Attention (MQA) otherwise GQA is used. When
            converting a multi-head checkpoint to a GQA checkpoint, each group key and value head should be constructed
            by meanpooling all the original heads within that group. For more details checkout [this
            paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf). If it is not specified, will default to
            `num_attention_heads`.

        layer_norm_eps (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1e-05):
            The epsilon used by the layer normalization.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not the model should return the last key/values attentions (not used by all models). Only
            relevant if `config.is_decoder=True`.
        pad_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):

            accordingly.
            Expected contents:
                `rope_type` (`str`):
                    The sub-variant of RoPE to use. Can be one of ['default', 'linear', 'dynamic', 'yarn', 'longrope',

                `factor` (`float`, *optional*):
                    Used with all rope types except 'default'. The scaling factor to apply to the RoPE embeddings. In
                    most scaling types, a `factor` of x will enable the model to handle sequences of length x *

                    Only used with 'yarn'. Parameter to set the boundary for extrapolation (only) in the linear
                    ramp function. If unspecified, it defaults to 32.

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import CohereModel, CohereConfig

    >>> # Initializing a Cohere model configuration
    >>> configuration = CohereConfig()

    >>> # Initializing a model from the Cohere configuration
    >>> model = CohereModel(configuration) # doctest: +SKIP

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config # doctest: +SKIP
    ```

## CohereTokenizerFast


    Construct a Cohere tokenizer. Based on byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This uses notably ByteFallback and NFC normalization.

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer

    >>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("CohereForAI/c4ai-command-r-v01")
    >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello this is a test")
    [5, 28339, 2075, 1801, 1671, 3282]
    ```

    If you want to change the `bos_token` or the `eos_token`, make sure to specify them when initializing the model, or
    call `tokenizer.update_post_processor()` to make sure that the post-processing is correctly done (otherwise the
    values of the first token and final token of an encoded sequence will not be correct). For more details, checkout
    [post-processors] (https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/api/post-processors) documentation.

    You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer, but since
    the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

    <Tip>

    When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer needs to be instantiated with `add_prefix_space=True`.

    </Tip>

## CohereModel

The bare Cohere Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`CohereConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Transformer decoder consisting of *config.num_hidden_layers* layers. Each layer is a [`CohereDecoderLayer`]

    Args:
        config: CohereConfig

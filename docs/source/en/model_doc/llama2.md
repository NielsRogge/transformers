# Llama2

## Overview

The Llama2 model was proposed in [LLaMA: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/) by Hugo Touvron, Louis Martin, Kevin Stone, Peter Albert, Amjad Almahairi, Yasmine Babaei, Nikolay Bashlykov, Soumya Batra, Prajjwal Bhargava, Shruti Bhosale, Dan Bikel, Lukas Blecher, Cristian Canton Ferrer, Moya Chen, Guillem Cucurull, David Esiobu, Jude Fernandes, Jeremy Fu, Wenyin Fu, Brian Fuller, Cynthia Gao, Vedanuj Goswami, Naman Goyal, Anthony Hartshorn, Saghar Hosseini, Rui Hou, Hakan Inan, Marcin Kardas, Viktor Kerkez Madian Khabsa, Isabel Kloumann, Artem Korenev, Punit Singh Koura, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Thibaut Lavril, Jenya Lee, Diana Liskovich, Yinghai Lu, Yuning Mao, Xavier Martinet, Todor Mihaylov, Pushka rMishra, Igor Molybog, Yixin Nie, Andrew Poulton, Jeremy Reizenstein, Rashi Rungta, Kalyan Saladi, Alan Schelten, Ruan Silva, Eric Michael Smith, Ranjan Subramanian, Xiaoqing EllenTan, Binh Tang, Ross Taylor, Adina Williams, Jian Xiang Kuan, Puxin Xu, Zheng Yan, Iliyan Zarov, Yuchen Zhang, Angela Fan, Melanie Kambadur, Sharan Narang, Aurelien Rodriguez, Robert Stojnic, Sergey Edunov, Thomas Scialom. It is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 70B parameters, with checkpoints finetuned for chat application!

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models. We provide a detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.*

Checkout all Llama2 model checkpoints [here](https://huggingface.co/models?search=llama2).
This model was contributed by [Arthur Zucker](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ) with contributions from [Lysandre Debut](https://huggingface.co/lysandre). The code of the implementation in Hugging Face is based on GPT-NeoX [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox). The original code of the authors can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama).

## Usage tips

<Tip warning={true}>

The `Llama2` models were trained using `bfloat16`, but the original inference uses `float16`. The checkpoints uploaded on the Hub use `torch_dtype = 'float16'`, which will be
used by the `AutoModel` API to cast the checkpoints from `torch.float32` to `torch.float16`. 

The `dtype` of the online weights is mostly irrelevant unless you are using `torch_dtype="auto"` when initializing a model using `model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path", torch_dtype = "auto")`. The reason is that the model will first be downloaded ( using the `dtype` of the checkpoints online), then it will be casted to the default `dtype` of `torch` (becomes `torch.float32`), and finally, if there is a `torch_dtype` provided in the config, it will be used. 

Training the model in `float16` is not recommended and is known to produce `nan`; as such, the model should be trained in `bfloat16`.

</Tip>

Tips:

- Weights for the Llama2 models can be obtained by filling out [this form](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)
- The architecture is very similar to the first Llama, with the addition of Grouped Query Attention (GQA) following this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf)
- Setting `config.pretraining_tp` to a value different than 1 will activate the more accurate but slower computation of the linear layers, which should better match the original logits.
- The original model uses `pad_id = -1` which means that there is no padding token. We can't have the same logic, make sure to add a padding token using `tokenizer.add_special_tokens({"pad_token":"<pad>"})` and resize the token embedding accordingly. You should also set the `model.config.pad_token_id`. The `embed_tokens` layer of the model is initialized with `self.embed_tokens = nn.Embedding(config.vocab_size, config.hidden_size, self.config.padding_idx)`, which makes sure that encoding the padding token will output zeros, so passing it when initializing is recommended.
- After filling out the form and gaining access to the model checkpoints, you should be able to use the already converted checkpoints. Otherwise, if you are converting your own model, feel free to use the [conversion script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py). The script can be called with the following (example) command:

```bash
python src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py \
    --input_dir /path/to/downloaded/llama/weights --model_size 7B --output_dir /output/path
```

- After conversion, the model and tokenizer can be loaded via:

```python
from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer

tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("/output/path")
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/output/path")
```

Note that executing the script requires enough CPU RAM to host the whole model in float16 precision (even if the biggest versions
come in several checkpoints they each contain a part of each weight of the model, so we need to load them all in RAM). For the 75B model, it's thus 145GB of RAM needed.

- The LLaMA tokenizer is a BPE model based on [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece). One quirk of sentencepiece is that when decoding a sequence, if the first token is the start of the word (e.g. "Banana"), the tokenizer does not prepend the prefix space to the string.

- When using Flash Attention 2 via `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"`, don't pass `torch_dtype` to the `from_pretrained` class method and use Automatic Mixed-Precision training. When using `Trainer`, it is simply specifying either `fp16` or `bf16` to `True`. Otherwise, make sure you are using `torch.autocast`. This is required because the Flash Attention only support `fp16` and `bf16` data type.

## LlamaConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`LlamaModel`]. It is used to instantiate an LLaMA
    model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
    defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the LLaMA-7B.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.


    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32000):
            Vocabulary size of the LLaMA model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`LlamaModel`]
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 4096):
            Dimension of the hidden representations.
        intermediate_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 11008):

            `num_key_value_heads=1` the model will use Multi Query Attention (MQA) otherwise GQA is used. When
            converting a multi-head checkpoint to a GQA checkpoint, each group key and value head should be constructed
            by meanpooling all the original heads within that group. For more details checkout [this
            paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf). If it is not specified, will default to
            `num_attention_heads`.

            Dictionary containing the scaling configuration for the RoPE embeddings. NOTE: if you apply new rope type
            and you expect the model to work on longer `max_position_embeddings`, we recommend you to update this value
            accordingly.
            Expected contents:

    ```


## LlamaTokenizer

    no padding token in the original model.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):

            The end of sequence token.
        pad_token (`str` or `tokenizers.AddedToken`, *optional*):
            A special token used to make arrays of tokens the same size for batching purpose. Will then be ignored by
            attention mechanisms or loss computation.
        sp_model_kwargs (`Dict[str, Any]`, `Optional`, *optional*):
            Will be passed to the `SentencePieceProcessor.__init__()` method. The [Python wrapper for
            SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/tree/master/python) can be used, among other things,
            to set:

            - `enable_sampling`: Enable subword regularization.
            - `nbest_size`: Sampling parameters for unigram. Invalid for BPE-Dropout.

              - `nbest_size = {0,1}`: No sampling is performed.
              - `nbest_size > 1`: samples from the nbest_size results.
              - `nbest_size < 0`: assuming that nbest_size is infinite and samples from the all hypothesis (lattice)
                using forward-filtering-and-backward-sampling algorithm.

            - `alpha`: Smoothing parameter for unigram sampling, and dropout probability of merge operations for
              BPE-dropout.

        add_bos_token (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to add an `bos_token` at the start of sequences.
        add_eos_token (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add an `eos_token` at the end of sequences.
        clean_up_tokenization_spaces (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to cleanup spaces after decoding, cleanup consists in removing potential artifacts like
            extra spaces.
        use_default_system_prompt (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the default system prompt for Llama should be used.
        spaces_between_special_tokens (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add spaces between special tokens.
        legacy (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not the `legacy` behavior of the tokenizer should be used. Legacy is before the merge of #24622
            and #25224 which includes fixes to properly handle tokens that appear after special tokens.
            Make sure to also set `from_slow` to `True`.
            A simple example:

            - `legacy=True`:
            ```python
            >>> from transformers import LlamaTokenizerFast

            >>> tokenizer = LlamaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("huggyllama/llama-7b", legacy=True, from_slow=True)
            >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello <s>.") # 869 is '‚ñÅ.'
            [1, 15043, 29871, 1, 869]
            ```
            - `legacy=False`:
            ```python
            >>> from transformers import LlamaTokenizerFast

            >>> tokenizer = LlamaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("huggyllama/llama-7b", legacy=False, from_slow=True)
            >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello <s>.")  # 29889 is '.'
            [1, 15043, 29871, 1, 29889]
            ```
            Checkout the [pull request](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565) for more details.
        add_prefix_space (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to add an initial space to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as any
            other word. Again, this should be set with `from_slow=True` to make sure it's taken into account.

## LlamaTokenizerFast


    Construct a Llama tokenizer. Based on byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This uses notably ByteFallback and no normalization.

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import LlamaTokenizerFast

    >>> tokenizer = LlamaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("hf-internal-testing/llama-tokenizer")
    >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello this is a test")
    [1, 15043, 445, 338, 263, 1243]
    ```

    If you want to change the `bos_token` or the `eos_token`, make sure to specify them when initializing the model, or
    call `tokenizer.update_post_processor()` to make sure that the post-processing is correctly done (otherwise the
    values of the first token and final token of an encoded sequence will not be correct). For more details, checkout
    [post-processors] (https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/api/post-processors) documentation.


    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should
    refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`, *optional*):
            [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) file (generally has a .model extension) that
            contains the vocabulary necessary to instantiate a tokenizer.
        tokenizer_file (`str`, *optional*):
            [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) file (generally has a .json extension) that
            contains everything needed to load the tokenizer.
        clean_up_tokenization_spaces (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to cleanup spaces after decoding, cleanup consists in removing potential artifacts like
            extra spaces.
        unk_token (`str` or `tokenizers.AddedToken`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        bos_token (`str` or `tokenizers.AddedToken`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.
        eos_token (`str` or `tokenizers.AddedToken`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.
        add_bos_token (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to add an `bos_token` at the start of sequences.
        add_eos_token (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add an `eos_token` at the end of sequences.
        use_default_system_prompt (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the default system prompt for Llama should be used
        legacy (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not the `legacy` behavior of the tokenizer should be used. Legacy is before the merge of #24622
            and #25224 which includes fixes to properly handle tokens that appear after special tokens.
            Make sure to also set `from_slow` to `True`.
            A simple example:

            - `legacy=True`:
            ```python
            >>> from transformers import LlamaTokenizerFast

            >>> tokenizer = LlamaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("huggyllama/llama-7b", legacy=True, from_slow=True)
            >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello <s>.") # 869 is '‚ñÅ.'
            [1, 15043, 29871, 1, 869]
            ```
            - `legacy=False`:
            ```python
            >>> from transformers import LlamaTokenizerFast

            >>> tokenizer = LlamaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("huggyllama/llama-7b", legacy=False, from_slow=True)
            >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello <s>.")  # 29889 is '.'
            [1, 15043, 29871, 1, 29889]
            ```

        add_prefix_space (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not the tokenizer should automatically add a prefix space

## LlamaModel

The bare LLaMA Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`LlamaConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Transformer decoder consisting of *config.num_hidden_layers* layers. Each layer is a [`LlamaDecoderLayer`]

    Args:
        config: LlamaConfig

## LlamaForSequenceClassification


    The LLaMa Model transformer with a sequence classification head on top (linear layer).

    [`LlamaForSequenceClassification`] uses the last token in order to do the classification, as other causal models
    (e.g. GPT-2) do.

    Since it does classification on the last token, it requires to know the position of the last token. If a
    `pad_token_id` is defined in the configuration, it finds the last token that is not a padding token in each row. If
    no `pad_token_id` is defined, it simply takes the last value in each row of the batch. Since it cannot guess the
    padding tokens when `inputs_embeds` are passed instead of `input_ids`, it does the same (take the last value in
    each row of the batch).

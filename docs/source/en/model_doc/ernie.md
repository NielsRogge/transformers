# ERNIE

## Overview
ERNIE is a series of powerful models proposed by baidu, especially in Chinese tasks,
including [ERNIE1.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09223), [ERNIE2.0](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/6428),
[ERNIE3.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02137), [ERNIE-Gram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12148), [ERNIE-health](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07244), etc.

These models are contributed by [nghuyong](https://huggingface.co/nghuyong) and the official code can be found in [PaddleNLP](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleNLP) (in PaddlePaddle).

### Usage example
Take `ernie-1.0-base-zh` as an example:

```Python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("nghuyong/ernie-1.0-base-zh")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("nghuyong/ernie-1.0-base-zh")
```

## ErnieConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`ErnieModel`] or a [`TFErnieModel`]. It is used to
    instantiate a ERNIE model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
    configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the ERNIE
    [nghuyong/ernie-3.0-base-zh](https://huggingface.co/nghuyong/ernie-3.0-base-zh) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.


    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 30522):
            Vocabulary size of the ERNIE model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`ErnieModel`] or [`TFErnieModel`].
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 768):
            Dimensionality of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.

        num_attention_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 12):

        hidden_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):

        attention_probs_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):
            The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.
        max_position_embeddings (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 512):
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with. Typically set this to something large
            just in case (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).
        type_vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2):
            The vocabulary size of the `token_type_ids` passed when calling [`ErnieModel`] or [`TFErnieModel`].

            For more information on `"relative_key_query"`, please refer to *Method 4* in [Improve Transformer Models
            with Better Relative Position Embeddings (Huang et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13658).

        classifier_dropout (`float`, *optional*):
            The dropout ratio for the classification head.

    Examples:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import ErnieConfig, ErnieModel

    >>> # Initializing a ERNIE nghuyong/ernie-3.0-base-zh style configuration
    >>> configuration = ErnieConfig()

    >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the nghuyong/ernie-3.0-base-zh style configuration
    >>> model = ErnieModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## Ernie specific outputs

Could not find docstring for models.ernie.modeling_ernie.ErnieForPreTrainingOutput

## ErnieModel

The bare Ernie Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`ErnieConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.


    The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
    cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
    all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
    Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

    To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set
    to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and
    `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

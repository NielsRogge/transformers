# Mixtral

## Overview

Mixtral-8x7B was introduced in the [Mixtral of Experts blogpost](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/) by Albert Jiang, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Arthur Mensch, Chris Bamford, Devendra Singh Chaplot, Diego de las Casas, Florian Bressand, Gianna Lengyel, Guillaume Lample, Lélio Renard Lavaud, Lucile Saulnier, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Pierre Stock, Teven Le Scao, Thibaut Lavril, Thomas Wang, Timothée Lacroix, William El Sayed.

The introduction of the blog post says:

*Today, the team is proud to release Mixtral 8x7B, a high-quality sparse mixture of experts models (SMoE) with open weights. Licensed under Apache 2.0. Mixtral outperforms Llama 2 70B on most benchmarks with 6x faster inference. It is the strongest open-weight model with a permissive license and the best model overall regarding cost/performance trade-offs. In particular, it matches or outperforms GPT3.5 on most standard benchmarks.*

Mixtral-8x7B is the second large language model (LLM) released by [mistral.ai](https://mistral.ai/), after [Mistral-7B](mistral).

### Architectural details

Mixtral-8x7B is a decoder-only Transformer with the following architectural choices:

- Mixtral is a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with 8 experts per MLP, with a total of 45 billion parameters. To learn more about mixture-of-experts, refer to the [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe).
- Despite the model having 45 billion parameters, the compute required for a single forward pass is the same as that of a 14 billion parameter model. This is because even though each of the experts have to be loaded in RAM (70B like ram requirement) each token from the hidden states are dispatched twice (top 2 routing) and thus the compute (the operation required at each forward computation) is just 2 X sequence_length. 

The following implementation details are shared with Mistral AI's first model [Mistral-7B](mistral):
- Sliding Window Attention - Trained with 8k context length and fixed cache size, with a theoretical attention span of 128K tokens
- GQA (Grouped Query Attention) - allowing faster inference and lower cache size.
- Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer - ensures that characters are never mapped to out of vocabulary tokens.

For more details refer to the [release blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/).

### License

`Mixtral-8x7B` is released under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Usage tips

The Mistral team has released 2 checkpoints:
- a base model, [Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1), which has been pre-trained to predict the next token on internet-scale data.
- an instruction tuned model, [Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1), which is the base model optimized for chat purposes using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO).

The base model can be used as follows:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1", device_map="auto")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1")

>>> prompt = "My favourite condiment is"

>>> model_inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
>>> model.to(device)

>>> generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]
"My favourite condiment is to ..."
```

The instruction tuned model can be used as follows:

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", device_map="auto")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1")

>>> messages = [
...     {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favourite condiment?"},
...     {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen!"},
...     {"role": "user", "content": "Do you have mayonnaise recipes?"}
... ]

>>> model_inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

>>> generated_ids = model.generate(model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]
"Mayonnaise can be made as follows: (...)"
```

As can be seen, the instruction-tuned model requires a [chat template](../chat_templating) to be applied to make sure the inputs are prepared in the right format.

## Speeding up Mixtral by using Flash Attention

The code snippets above showcase inference without any optimization tricks. However, one can drastically speed up the model by leveraging [Flash Attention](../perf_train_gpu_one#flash-attention-2), which is a faster implementation of the attention mechanism used inside the model.

First, make sure to install the latest version of Flash Attention 2 to include the sliding window attention feature.

```bash
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Make also sure that you have a hardware that is compatible with Flash-Attention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of the [flash attention repository](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). Make also sure to load your model in half-precision (e.g. `torch.float16`)

To load and run a model using Flash Attention-2, refer to the snippet below:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1", torch_dtype=torch.float16, attn_implementation="flash_attention_2", device_map="auto")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1")

>>> prompt = "My favourite condiment is"

>>> model_inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
>>> model.to(device)

>>> generated_ids = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]
"The expected output"
```

### Expected speedups

</div>

### Sliding window Attention

The current implementation supports the sliding window attention mechanism and memory efficient cache management. 
To enable sliding window attention, just make sure to have a `flash-attn` version that is compatible with sliding window attention (`>=2.3.0`). 

The Flash Attention-2 model uses also a more memory efficient cache slicing mechanism - as recommended per the official implementation of Mistral model that use rolling cache mechanism we keep the cache size fixed (`self.config.sliding_window`), support batched generation only for `padding_side="left"` and use the absolute position of the current token to compute the positional embedding.

## Shrinking down Mixtral using quantization

As the Mixtral model has 45 billion parameters, that would require about 90GB of GPU RAM in half precision (float16), since each parameter is stored in 2 bytes. However, one can shrink down the size of the model using [quantization](../quantization.md). If the model is quantized to 4 bits (or half a byte per parameter), a single A100 with 40GB of RAM is enough to fit the entire model, as in that case only about 27 GB of RAM is required.

Quantizing a model is as simple as passing a `quantization_config` to the model. Below, we'll leverage the bitsandbytes quantization library (but refer to [this page](../quantization.md) for alternative quantization methods):

```python
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, BitsAndBytesConfig

>>> # specify how to quantize the model
>>> quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
...         load_in_4bit=True,
...         bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
...         bnb_4bit_compute_dtype="torch.float16",
... )

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1", quantization_config=True, device_map="auto")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1")

>>> prompt = "My favourite condiment is"

>>> messages = [
...     {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favourite condiment?"},
...     {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen!"},
...     {"role": "user", "content": "Do you have mayonnaise recipes?"}
... ]

>>> model_inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

>>> generated_ids = model.generate(model_inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True)
>>> tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)[0]
"The expected output"
```

## MixtralConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`MixtralModel`]. It is used to instantiate an
    Mixtral model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Mixtral-7B-v0.1 or Mixtral-7B-Instruct-v0.1.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

## MixtralModel

The bare Mixtral Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`MixtralConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Transformer decoder consisting of *config.num_hidden_layers* layers. Each layer is a [`MixtralDecoderLayer`]

Methods: forward

## MixtralForSequenceClassification


    The Mixtral Model transformer with a sequence classification head on top (linear layer).

    [`MixtralForSequenceClassification`] uses the last token in order to do the classification, as other causal models
    (e.g. GPT-2) do.

    Since it does classification on the last token, it requires to know the position of the last token. If a
    `pad_token_id` is defined in the configuration, it finds the last token that is not a padding token in each row. If
    no `pad_token_id` is defined, it simply takes the last value in each row of the batch. Since it cannot guess the
    padding tokens when `inputs_embeds` are passed instead of `input_ids`, it does the same (take the last value in
    each row of the batch).
    
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`MixtralConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

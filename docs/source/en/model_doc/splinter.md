# Splinter

## Overview

The Splinter model was proposed in [Few-Shot Question Answering by Pretraining Span Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00438) by Ori Ram, Yuval Kirstain, Jonathan Berant, Amir Globerson, Omer Levy. Splinter
is an encoder-only transformer (similar to BERT) pretrained using the recurring span selection task on a large corpus
comprising Wikipedia and the Toronto Book Corpus.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

In several question answering benchmarks, pretrained models have reached human parity through fine-tuning on an order
of 100,000 annotated questions and answers. We explore the more realistic few-shot setting, where only a few hundred
training examples are available, and observe that standard models perform poorly, highlighting the discrepancy between
current pretraining objectives and question answering. We propose a new pretraining scheme tailored for question
answering: recurring span selection. Given a passage with multiple sets of recurring spans, we mask in each set all
recurring spans but one, and ask the model to select the correct span in the passage for each masked span. Masked spans
are replaced with a special token, viewed as a question representation, that is later used during fine-tuning to select
the answer span. The resulting model obtains surprisingly good results on multiple benchmarks (e.g., 72.7 F1 on SQuAD
with only 128 training examples), while maintaining competitive performance in the high-resource setting.

This model was contributed by [yuvalkirstain](https://huggingface.co/yuvalkirstain) and [oriram](https://huggingface.co/oriram). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/oriram/splinter).

## Usage tips

- Splinter was trained to predict answers spans conditioned on a special [QUESTION] token. These tokens contextualize
  to question representations which are used to predict the answers. This layer is called QASS, and is the default
  behaviour in the [`SplinterForQuestionAnswering`] class. Therefore:
- Use [`SplinterTokenizer`] (rather than [`BertTokenizer`]), as it already
  contains this special token. Also, its default behavior is to use this token when two sequences are given (for
  example, in the *run_qa.py* script).
- If you plan on using Splinter outside *run_qa.py*, please keep in mind the question token - it might be important for
  the success of your model, especially in a few-shot setting.
- Please note there are two different checkpoints for each size of Splinter. Both are basically the same, except that
  one also has the pretrained weights of the QASS layer (*tau/splinter-base-qass* and *tau/splinter-large-qass*) and one
  doesn't (*tau/splinter-base* and *tau/splinter-large*). This is done to support randomly initializing this layer at
  fine-tuning, as it is shown to yield better results for some cases in the paper.

## SplinterConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`SplinterModel`]. It is used to instantiate an
    Splinter model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Splinter
    [tau/splinter-base](https://huggingface.co/tau/splinter-base) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.


    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 30522):
            Vocabulary size of the Splinter model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by
            the `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`SplinterModel`].

        hidden_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):
            The dropout probability for all fully connected layers in the embeddings, encoder, and pooler.
        attention_probs_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):
            The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.
        max_position_embeddings (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 512):
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with. Typically set this to something large
            just in case (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).
        type_vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2):
            The vocabulary size of the `token_type_ids` passed when calling [`SplinterModel`].

            The epsilon used by the layer normalization layers.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not the model should return the last key/values attentions (not used by all models). Only
            relevant if `config.is_decoder=True`.
        question_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 104):
            The id of the `[QUESTION]` token.

    Example:

    ```python

    >>> # Initializing a model from the tau/splinter-base style configuration
    >>> model = SplinterModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## SplinterTokenizer


    Construct a Splinter tokenizer. Based on WordPiece.

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            File containing the vocabulary.
        do_lower_case (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):

            Whether or not to do basic tokenization before WordPiece.
        never_split (`Iterable`, *optional*):
            Collection of tokens which will never be split during tokenization. Only has an effect when
            `do_basic_tokenize=True`
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[UNK]"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[SEP]"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[PAD]"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[CLS]"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[MASK]"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
        question_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[QUESTION]"`):
            The token used for constructing question representations.
        tokenize_chinese_chars (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to tokenize Chinese characters.

            This should likely be deactivated for Japanese (see this
            [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/328)).
        strip_accents (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to strip all accents. If this option is not specified, then it will be determined by the
            value for `lowercase` (as in the original BERT).

## SplinterModel

The bare Splinter Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
    it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`SplinterConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    The model is an encoder (with only self-attention) following the architecture described in [Attention is all you
    need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones,
    Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

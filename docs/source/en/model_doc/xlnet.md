## Overview

The XLNet model was proposed in [XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08237) by Zhilin Yang, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Jaime Carbonell, Ruslan Salakhutdinov,
Quoc V. Le. XLnet is an extension of the Transformer-XL model pre-trained using an autoregressive method to learn
bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the input sequence factorization
order.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves
better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on
corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a
pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive
pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all
permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive
formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into
pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large
margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.*

This model was contributed by [thomwolf](https://huggingface.co/thomwolf). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet/).

## Usage tips

- The specific attention pattern can be controlled at training and test time using the `perm_mask` input.
- Due to the difficulty of training a fully auto-regressive model over various factorization order, XLNet is pretrained
  using only a sub-set of the output tokens as target which are selected with the `target_mapping` input.
- To use XLNet for sequential decoding (i.e. not in fully bi-directional setting), use the `perm_mask` and
  `target_mapping` inputs to control the attention span and outputs (see examples in
  *examples/pytorch/text-generation/run_generation.py*)
- XLNet is one of the few models that has no sequence length limit.
- XLNet is not a traditional autoregressive model but uses a training strategy that builds on that. It permutes the tokens in the sentence, then allows the model to use the last n tokens to predict the token n+1. Since this is all done with a mask, the sentence is actually fed in the model in the right order, but instead of masking the first n tokens for n+1, XLNet uses a mask that hides the previous tokens in some given permutation of 1,…,sequence length.
- XLNet also uses the same recurrence mechanism as Transformer-XL to build long-term dependencies.

## XLNetConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`XLNetModel`] or a [`TFXLNetModel`]. It is used to
    instantiate a XLNet model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
    configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the
    [xlnet/xlnet-large-cased](https://huggingface.co/xlnet/xlnet-large-cased) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32000):
            Vocabulary size of the XLNet model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`XLNetModel`] or [`TFXLNetModel`].
        d_model (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1024):
            Dimensionality of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.

        bi_data (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to use bidirectional input pipeline. Usually set to `True` during pretraining and `False`
            during finetuning.
        clamp_len (`int`, *optional*, defaults to -1):
            Clamp all relative distances larger than clamp_len. Setting this attribute to -1 means no clamping.

                - `"cls_index"`: Supply a Tensor of classification token position (like GPT/GPT-2).
                - `"attn"`: Not implemented now, use multi-head attention.

            Argument used when doing sequence summary. Used in the sequence classification and multiple choice models.

            Pass `"tanh"` for a tanh activation to the output, any other value will result in no activation.
        summary_proj_to_labels (`boo`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Used in the sequence classification and multiple choice models.

            Whether the projection outputs should have `config.num_labels` or `config.hidden_size` classes.
        summary_last_dropout (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):

            The dropout ratio to be used after the projection and activation.
        start_n_top (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 5):
            Used in the SQuAD evaluation script.
        end_n_top (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 5):

            Whether or not the model should make use of the recurrent memory mechanism in train mode.

            <Tip>

            For pretraining, it is recommended to set `use_mems_train` to `True`. For fine-tuning, it is recommended to
            set `use_mems_train` to `False` as discussed
            [here](https://github.com/zihangdai/xlnet/issues/41#issuecomment-505102587). If `use_mems_train` is set to
            `True`, one has to make sure that the train batches are correctly pre-processed, *e.g.* `batch_1 = [[This
            line is], [This is the]]` and `batch_2 = [[ the first line], [ second line]]` and that all batches are of
            equal size.

            </Tip>

    Examples:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import XLNetConfig, XLNetModel

    >>> # Initializing a XLNet configuration
    >>> configuration = XLNetConfig()

    >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the configuration
    >>> model = XLNetModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## XLNetModel

The bare XLNet Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`XLNetConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the

# ViTMatte

## Overview

The ViTMatte model was proposed in [Boosting Image Matting with Pretrained Plain Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15272) by Jingfeng Yao, Xinggang Wang, Shusheng Yang, Baoyuan Wang.
ViTMatte leverages plain [Vision Transformers](vit) for the task of image matting, which is the process of accurately estimating the foreground object in images and videos.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Recently, plain vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance on various computer vision tasks, thanks to their strong modeling capacity and large-scale pretraining. However, they have not yet conquered the problem of image matting. We hypothesize that image matting could also be boosted by ViTs and present a new efficient and robust ViT-based matting system, named ViTMatte. Our method utilizes (i) a hybrid attention mechanism combined with a convolution neck to help ViTs achieve an excellent performance-computation trade-off in matting tasks. (ii) Additionally, we introduce the detail capture module, which just consists of simple lightweight convolutions to complement the detailed information required by matting. To the best of our knowledge, ViTMatte is the first work to unleash the potential of ViT on image matting with concise adaptation. It inherits many superior properties from ViT to matting, including various pretraining strategies, concise architecture design, and flexible inference strategies. We evaluate ViTMatte on Composition-1k and Distinctions-646, the most commonly used benchmark for image matting, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms prior matting works by a large margin.*

## Resources

A list of official Hugging Face and community (indicated by ðŸŒŽ) resources to help you get started with ViTMatte.

- A demo notebook regarding inference with [`VitMatteForImageMatting`], including background replacement, can be found [here](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/ViTMatte).

<Tip>

The model expects both the image and trimap (concatenated) as input. Use [`ViTMatteImageProcessor`] for this purpose.

## VitMatteConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of [`VitMatteForImageMatting`]. It is used to
    instantiate a ViTMatte model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
    configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the ViTMatte
    [hustvl/vitmatte-small-composition-1k](https://huggingface.co/hustvl/vitmatte-small-composition-1k) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Args:
        backbone_config (`PretrainedConfig` or `dict`, *optional*, defaults to `VitDetConfig()`):
            The configuration of the backbone model.
        backbone (`str`, *optional*):
            Name of backbone to use when `backbone_config` is `None`. If `use_pretrained_backbone` is `True`, this
            will load the corresponding pretrained weights from the timm or transformers library. If `use_pretrained_backbone`
            is `False`, this loads the backbone's config and uses that to initialize the backbone with random weights.
        use_pretrained_backbone (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use pretrained weights for the backbone.
        use_timm_backbone (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to load `backbone` from the timm library. If `False`, the backbone is loaded from the transformers
            library.
        backbone_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*):
            Keyword arguments to be passed to AutoBackbone when loading from a checkpoint
            e.g. `{'out_indices': (0, 1, 2, 3)}`. Cannot be specified if `backbone_config` is set.
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 384):
            The number of input channels of the decoder.
        batch_norm_eps (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1e-05):
            The epsilon used by the batch norm layers.
        initializer_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02):
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        convstream_hidden_sizes (`List[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[48, 96, 192]`):
            The output channels of the ConvStream module.
        fusion_hidden_sizes (`List[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[256, 128, 64, 32]`):
            The output channels of the Fusion blocks.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import VitMatteConfig, VitMatteForImageMatting

    >>> # Initializing a ViTMatte hustvl/vitmatte-small-composition-1k style configuration
    >>> configuration = VitMatteConfig()

    >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the hustvl/vitmatte-small-composition-1k style configuration
    >>> model = VitMatteForImageMatting(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## VitMatteImageProcessor


    Constructs a ViTMatte image processor.

    Args:
        do_rescale (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to rescale the image by the specified scale `rescale_factor`. Can be overridden by the `do_rescale`
            parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        rescale_factor (`int` or `float`, *optional*, defaults to `1/255`):
            Scale factor to use if rescaling the image. Can be overridden by the `rescale_factor` parameter in the
            `preprocess` method.
        do_normalize (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to normalize the image. Can be overridden by the `do_normalize` parameter in the `preprocess`
            method.
        image_mean (`float` or `List[float]`, *optional*, defaults to `IMAGENET_STANDARD_MEAN`):
            Mean to use if normalizing the image. This is a float or list of floats the length of the number of
            channels in the image. Can be overridden by the `image_mean` parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        image_std (`float` or `List[float]`, *optional*, defaults to `IMAGENET_STANDARD_STD`):
            Standard deviation to use if normalizing the image. This is a float or list of floats the length of the
            number of channels in the image. Can be overridden by the `image_std` parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        do_pad (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to pad the image to make the width and height divisible by `size_divisibility`. Can be overridden
            by the `do_pad` parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        size_divisibility (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):
            The width and height of the image will be padded to be divisible by this number.

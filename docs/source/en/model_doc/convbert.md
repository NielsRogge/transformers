## Overview

The ConvBERT model was proposed in [ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02496) by Zihang Jiang, Weihao Yu, Daquan Zhou, Yunpeng Chen, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng
Yan.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various
natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers
large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for
generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies,
which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to
replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the
rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context
learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that
ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and
fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while
using less than 1/4 training cost. Code and pre-trained models will be released.*

This model was contributed by [abhishek](https://huggingface.co/abhishek). The original implementation can be found

## Usage tips

ConvBERT training tips are similar to those of BERT. For usage tips refer to [BERT documentation](bert).

## ConvBertConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`ConvBertModel`]. It is used to instantiate an
    ConvBERT model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the ConvBERT
    [YituTech/conv-bert-base](https://huggingface.co/YituTech/conv-bert-base) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

        never_split (`Iterable`, *optional*):
            Collection of tokens which will never be split during tokenization. Only has an effect when
            `do_basic_tokenize=True`
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[UNK]"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[SEP]"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[PAD]"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[CLS]"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[MASK]"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language

        tokenize_chinese_chars (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to tokenize Chinese characters.

            This should likely be deactivated for Japanese (see this
            [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/328)).
        strip_accents (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to strip all accents. If this option is not specified, then it will be determined by the
            value for `lowercase` (as in the original ConvBERT).
        clean_up_tokenization_spaces (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to cleanup spaces after decoding, cleanup consists in removing potential artifacts like
            extra spaces.

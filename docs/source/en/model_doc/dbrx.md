# DBRX

## Overview

DBRX is a [transformer-based](https://www.isattentionallyouneed.com/) decoder-only large language model (LLM) that was trained using next-token prediction.
It uses a *fine-grained* mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with 132B total parameters of which 36B parameters are active on any input.
It was pre-trained on 12T tokens of text and code data.
Compared to other open MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B and Grok-1, DBRX is fine-grained, meaning it uses a larger number of smaller experts. DBRX has 16 experts and chooses 4, while Mixtral-8x7B and Grok-1 have 8 experts and choose 2.
This provides 65x more possible combinations of experts and we found that this improves model quality.
DBRX uses rotary position encodings (RoPE), gated linear units (GLU), and grouped query attention (GQA).
It is a BPE based model and uses the GPT-4 tokenizer as described in the [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) repository.
We made these choices based on exhaustive evaluation and scaling experiments.

DBRX was pretrained on 12T tokens of carefully curated data and a maximum context length of 32K tokens.
We estimate that this data is at least 2x better token-for-token than the data we used to pretrain the MPT family of models.
This new dataset was developed using the full suite of Databricks tools, including Apache Sparkâ„¢ and Databricks notebooks for data processing, and Unity Catalog for data management and governance.
We used curriculum learning for pretraining, changing the data mix during training in ways we found to substantially improve model quality.


More detailed information about DBRX Instruct and DBRX Base can be found in our [technical blog post](https://www.databricks.com/blog/introducing-dbrx-new-state-art-open-llm).

This model was contributed by [eitan-turok](https://huggingface.co/eitanturok) and [abhi-db](https://huggingface.co/abhi-db). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/databricks/dbrx-instruct), though this may not be up to date.

## Usage Examples

The `generate()` method can be used to generate text using DBRX. You can generate using the standard attention implementation, flash-attention, and the PyTorch scaled dot product attention. The last two attention implementations give speed ups.

```python
from transformers import DbrxForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("databricks/dbrx-instruct", token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN")
model = DbrxForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "databricks/dbrx-instruct",
    device_map="auto",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN",
    )

input_text = "What does it take to build a great LLM?"
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": input_text}]
input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_dict=True, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

outputs = model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=200)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```

If you have flash-attention installed (`pip install flash-attn`), it is possible to generate faster. (The HuggingFace documentation for flash-attention can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_infer_gpu_one#flashattention-2).)
```python
from transformers import DbrxForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("databricks/dbrx-instruct", token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN")
model = DbrxForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "databricks/dbrx-instruct",
    device_map="auto",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN",
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
    )

input_text = "What does it take to build a great LLM?"
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": input_text}]
input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_dict=True, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

outputs = model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=200)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```

You can also generate faster using the PyTorch scaled dot product attention. (The HuggingFace documentation for scaled dot product attention can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perf_infer_gpu_one#pytorch-scaled-dot-product-attention).)
```python
from transformers import DbrxForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("databricks/dbrx-instruct", token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN")
model = DbrxForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "databricks/dbrx-instruct",
    device_map="auto",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN",
    attn_implementation="sdpa",
    )

input_text = "What does it take to build a great LLM?"
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": input_text}]
input_ids = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_dict=True, tokenize=True, add_generation_prompt=True, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

outputs = model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=200)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))
```

## DbrxConfig



    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`DbrxModel`]. It is used to instantiate a Dbrx model according to the
    specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
    defaults will yield a different configuration to that of the [databricks/dbrx-instruct](https://huggingface.co/databricks/dbrx-instruct) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.


    Args:
        d_model (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2048):
            Dimensionality of the embeddings and hidden states.
        n_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 16):
            Number of attention heads for each attention layer in the Transformer encoder.
        n_layers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 24):
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer encoder.
        max_seq_len (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2048):
            The maximum sequence length of the model.
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32000):
            Vocabulary size of the Dbrx model. Defines the maximum number of different tokens that can be represented by
            the `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`DbrxModel`].
        resid_pdrop (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            The dropout probability applied to the attention output before combining with residual.
        emb_pdrop (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            The dropout probability for the embedding layer.
        attn_config (`dict`, *optional*):
            A dictionary used to configure the model's attention module.
        ffn_config (`dict`, *optional*):
            A dictionary used to configure the model's FFN module.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not the model should return the last key/values attentions (not used by all models).
        initializer_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02):
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        output_router_logits (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the router logits should be returned by the model. Enabling this will also
            allow the model to output the auxiliary loss. See [here]() for more details.


    Example:
    ```python
    >>> from transformers import DbrxConfig, DbrxModel

    >>> # Initializing a Dbrx configuration
    >>> configuration = DbrxConfig(n_layers=2, d_model=256, n_heads=8, vocab_size=128)

    >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the configuration
    >>> model = DbrxModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```
    


## DbrxModel

The bare DBRX Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`DbrxConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.
Transformer decoder consisting of *config.num_hidden_layers*. Each layer is a [`DbrxBlock`] layer.

    Args:
        config ([`DbrxConfig`]): Model configuration class with all parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

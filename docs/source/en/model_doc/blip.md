# BLIP

## Overview

The BLIP model was proposed in [BLIP: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training for Unified Vision-Language Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12086) by Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Caiming Xiong, Steven Hoi.

BLIP is a model that is able to perform various multi-modal tasks including:
- Visual Question Answering 
- Image-Text retrieval (Image-text matching)
- Image Captioning

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) has advanced the performance for many vision-language tasks. 
However, most existing pre-trained models only excel in either understanding-based tasks or generation-based tasks. Furthermore, performance improvement has been largely achieved by scaling up the dataset with noisy image-text pairs collected from the web, which is a suboptimal source of supervision. In this paper, we propose BLIP, a new VLP framework which transfers flexibly to both vision-language understanding and generation tasks. BLIP effectively utilizes the noisy web data by bootstrapping the captions, where a captioner generates synthetic captions and a filter removes the noisy ones. We achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language tasks, such as image-text retrieval (+2.7% in average recall@1), image captioning (+2.8% in CIDEr), and VQA (+1.6% in VQA score). BLIP also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to videolanguage tasks in a zero-shot manner. Code, models, and datasets are released.*

## BlipConfig


    [`BlipConfig`] is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`BlipModel`]. It is used to instantiate
    a BLIP model according to the specified arguments, defining the text model and vision model configs. Instantiating
    a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the BLIP-base
    [Salesforce/blip-vqa-base](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip-vqa-base) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Args:
        text_config (`dict`, *optional*):
            Dictionary of configuration options used to initialize [`BlipTextConfig`].
        vision_config (`dict`, *optional*):
            Dictionary of configuration options used to initialize [`BlipVisionConfig`].
        projection_dim (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 512):
            Dimensionality of text and vision projection layers.
        logit_scale_init_value (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 2.6592):
            The initial value of the *logit_scale* parameter. Default is used as per the original BLIP implementation.
        image_text_hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 256):
            Dimensionality of the hidden state of the image-text fusion layer.
        label_smoothing (float, optional, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            A float in [0.0, 1.0]. Specifies the amount of smoothing when computing the loss, where 0.0 means no smoothing. The targets
            become a mixture of the original ground truth and a uniform distribution as described in
            `Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567>`__. Default: :math:`0.0`.
        kwargs (*optional*):
            Dictionary of keyword arguments.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import BlipConfig, BlipModel

    >>> # Initializing a BlipConfig with Salesforce/blip-vqa-base style configuration
    >>> configuration = BlipConfig()

    >>> # Initializing a BlipPModel (with random weights) from the Salesforce/blip-vqa-base style configuration
    >>> model = BlipModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config

    >>> # We can also initialize a BlipConfig from a BlipTextConfig and a BlipVisionConfig

    >>> # Initializing a BLIPText and BLIPVision configuration

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`BlipConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the

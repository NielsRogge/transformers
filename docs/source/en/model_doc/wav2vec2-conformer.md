# Wav2Vec2-Conformer

## Overview

The Wav2Vec2-Conformer was added to an updated version of [fairseq S2T: Fast Speech-to-Text Modeling with fairseq](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05171) by Changhan Wang, Yun Tang, Xutai Ma, Anne Wu, Sravya Popuri, Dmytro Okhonko, Juan Pino.

The official results of the model can be found in Table 3 and Table 4 of the paper.

The Wav2Vec2-Conformer weights were released by the Meta AI team within the [Fairseq library](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/blob/main/examples/wav2vec/README.md#pre-trained-models).

This model was contributed by [patrickvonplaten](https://huggingface.co/patrickvonplaten).
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/main/examples/wav2vec).

Note: Meta (FAIR) released a new version of [Wav2Vec2-BERT 2.0](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/wav2vec2-bert) - it's pretrained on 4.5M hours of audio. We especially recommend using it for fine-tuning tasks, e.g. as per [this guide](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-w2v2-bert).

## Usage tips

- Wav2Vec2-Conformer follows the same architecture as Wav2Vec2, but replaces the *Attention*-block with a *Conformer*-block
  as introduced in [Conformer: Convolution-augmented Transformer for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08100).
- For the same number of layers, Wav2Vec2-Conformer requires more parameters than Wav2Vec2, but also yields 
an improved word error rate.
- Wav2Vec2-Conformer uses the same tokenizer and feature extractor as Wav2Vec2.
- Wav2Vec2-Conformer can use either no relative position embeddings, Transformer-XL-like position embeddings, or
  rotary position embeddings by setting the correct `config.position_embeddings_type`.

    regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`Wav2Vec2ConformerConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

## Wav2Vec2ConformerForPreTraining

Wav2Vec2Conformer Model with a quantizer and `VQ` head on top.
    Wav2Vec2Conformer was proposed in [wav2vec 2.0: A Framework for Self-Supervised Learning of Speech
    Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477) by Alexei Baevski, Henry Zhou, Abdelrahman Mohamed, Michael
    Auli.

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving etc.).

    This model is a PyTorch [nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#nn.Module) sub-class. Use it as a
    regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`Wav2Vec2ConformerConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

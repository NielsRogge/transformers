# UDOP

## Overview

The UDOP model was proposed in [Unifying Vision, Text, and Layout for Universal Document Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02623) by Zineng Tang, Ziyi Yang, Guoxin Wang, Yuwei Fang, Yang Liu, Chenguang Zhu, Michael Zeng, Cha Zhang, Mohit Bansal.
UDOP adopts an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture based on [T5](t5) for document AI tasks like document image classification, document parsing and document visual question answering.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

We propose Universal Document Processing (UDOP), a foundation Document AI model which unifies text, image, and layout modalities together with varied task formats, including document understanding and generation. UDOP leverages the spatial correlation between textual content and document image to model image, text, and layout modalities with one uniform representation. With a novel Vision-Text-Layout Transformer, UDOP unifies pretraining and multi-domain downstream tasks into a prompt-based sequence generation scheme. UDOP is pretrained on both large-scale unlabeled document corpora using innovative self-supervised objectives and diverse labeled data. UDOP also learns to generate document images from text and layout modalities via masked image reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the field of document AI that one model simultaneously achieves high-quality neural document editing and content customization. Our method sets the state-of-the-art on 9 Document AI tasks, e.g., document understanding and QA, across diverse data domains like finance reports, academic papers, and websites. UDOP ranks first on the leaderboard of the Document Understanding Benchmark (DUE).*

## Usage tips

- In addition to *input_ids*, [`UdopForConditionalGeneration`] also expects the input `bbox`, which are
  the bounding boxes (i.e. 2D-positions) of the input tokens. These can be obtained using an external OCR engine such
  as Google's [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) (there's a [Python wrapper](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) available). Each bounding box should be in (x0, y0, x1, y1) format, where (x0, y0) corresponds to the position of the upper left corner in the bounding box, and (x1, y1) represents the
  position of the lower right corner. Note that one first needs to normalize the bounding boxes to be on a 0-1000
  scale. To normalize, you can use the following function:

```python
def normalize_bbox(bbox, width, height):
    return [
        int(1000 * (bbox[0] / width)),
        int(1000 * (bbox[1] / height)),
        int(1000 * (bbox[2] / width)),
        int(1000 * (bbox[3] / height)),
    ]
```

Here, `width` and `height` correspond to the width and height of the original document in which the token
occurs. Those can be obtained using the Python Image Library (PIL) library for example, as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image

# Document can be a png, jpg, etc. PDFs must be converted to images.
image = Image.open(name_of_your_document).convert("RGB")

width, height = image.size
```

One can use [`UdopProcessor`] to prepare images and text for the model, which takes care of all of this. By default, this class uses the Tesseract engine to extract a list of words and boxes (coordinates) from a given document. Its functionality is equivalent to that of [`LayoutLMv3Processor`], hence it supports passing either `apply_ocr=False` in case you prefer to use your own OCR engine or `apply_ocr=True` in case you want the default OCR engine to be used. Refer to the [usage guide of LayoutLMv2](layoutlmv2#usage-layoutlmv2processor) regarding all possible use cases (the functionality of `UdopProcessor` is identical).

- If using an own OCR engine of choice, one recommendation is Azure's [Read API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/how-to/call-read-api), which supports so-called line segments. Use of segment position embeddings typically results in better performance.
- At inference time, it's recommended to use the `generate` method to autoregressively generate text given a document image.
- The model has been pre-trained on both self-supervised and supervised objectives. One can use the various task prefixes (prompts) used during pre-training to test out the out-of-the-box capabilities. For instance, the model can be prompted with "Question answering. What is the date?", as "Question answering." is the task prefix used during pre-training for DocVQA. Refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02623) (table 1) for all task prefixes.
- One can also fine-tune [`UdopEncoderModel`], which is the encoder-only part of UDOP, which can be seen as a LayoutLMv3-like Transformer encoder. For discriminative tasks, one can just add a linear classifier on top of it and fine-tune it on a labeled dataset.

This model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr).

## UdopTokenizer


    Adapted from [`LayoutXLMTokenizer`] and [`T5Tokenizer`]. Based on

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            Path to the vocabulary file.

        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.

            </Tip>

        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.

        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.

        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.

        pad_token_label (`int`, *optional*, defaults to -100):
            The label to use for padding tokens. Defaults to -100, which is the `ignore_index` of PyTorch's
            CrossEntropyLoss.
        only_label_first_subword (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to only label the first subword, in case word labels are provided.

            Additional special tokens used by the tokenizer.

        sp_model_kwargs (`dict`, *optional*):
            Will be passed to the `SentencePieceProcessor.__init__()` method. The [Python wrapper for
            SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/tree/master/python) can be used, among other things,
            to set:

            - `enable_sampling`: Enable subword regularization.
            - `nbest_size`: Sampling parameters for unigram. Invalid for BPE-Dropout.

              - `nbest_size = {0,1}`: No sampling is performed.
              - `nbest_size > 1`: samples from the nbest_size results.
              - `nbest_size < 0`: assuming that nbest_size is infinite and samples from the all hypothesis (lattice)
                using forward-filtering-and-backward-sampling algorithm.

            - `alpha`: Smoothing parameter for unigram sampling, and dropout probability of merge operations for
              BPE-dropout.
        legacy (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not the `legacy` behaviour of the tokenizer should be used. Legacy is before the merge of #24622
            which includes fixes to properly handle tokens that appear after special tokens. A simple example:
            - `legacy=True`:
            ```python
            >>> from transformers import T5Tokenizer

            >>> tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-base", legacy=True)
            >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello <extra_id_0>.")
            [8774, 32099, 3, 5, 1]
            ```
            - `legacy=False`:
            ```python
            >>> from transformers import T5Tokenizer

            >>> tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained("t5-base", legacy=False)
            >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello <extra_id_0>.")  # the extra space `[3]` is no longer here
            [8774, 32099, 5, 1]
            ```

## UdopProcessor


    Constructs a UDOP processor which combines a LayoutLMv3 image processor and a UDOP tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`UdopProcessor`] offers all the functionalities you need to prepare data for the model.

    It first uses [`LayoutLMv3ImageProcessor`] to resize, rescale and normalize document images, and optionally applies OCR
    to get words and normalized bounding boxes. These are then provided to [`UdopTokenizer`] or [`UdopTokenizerFast`],
    which turns the words and bounding boxes into token-level `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `token_type_ids`, `bbox`.
    Optionally, one can provide integer `word_labels`, which are turned into token-level `labels` for token
    classification tasks (such as FUNSD, CORD).

    Additionally, it also supports passing `text_target` and `text_pair_target` to the tokenizer, which can be used to
    prepare labels for language modeling tasks.

    Args:
        image_processor (`LayoutLMv3ImageProcessor`):
            An instance of [`LayoutLMv3ImageProcessor`]. The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer (`UdopTokenizer` or `UdopTokenizerFast`):
            An instance of [`UdopTokenizer`] or [`UdopTokenizerFast`]. The tokenizer is a required input.

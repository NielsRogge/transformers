# OLMo2

## Overview

The OLMo2 model is the successor of the OLMo model, which was proposed in
[OLMo: Accelerating the Science of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00838).

 The architectural changes from the original OLMo model to this model are:

- RMSNorm is used instead of standard layer norm.
- Norm is applied to attention queries and keys.
- Norm is applied after attention/feedforward layers rather than before.

This model was contributed by [shanearora](https://huggingface.co/shanearora).
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/allenai/OLMo/tree/main/olmo).


## Olmo2Config


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`Olmo2Model`]. It is used to instantiate an OLMo2
    model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
    defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the [allenai/Olmo2-7B-1124-hf](https://huggingface.co/allenai/Olmo2-7B-1124-hf).

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.


    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 50304):
            Vocabulary size of the Olmo2 model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`Olmo2Model`]
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 4096):
            Dimension of the hidden representations.
        intermediate_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 11008):
            Dimension of the MLP representations.
        num_hidden_layers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer decoder.
        num_attention_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):
            Number of attention heads for each attention layer in the Transformer decoder.
        num_key_value_heads (`int`, *optional*):
            This is the number of key_value heads that should be used to implement Grouped Query Attention. If
            `num_key_value_heads=num_attention_heads`, the model will use Multi Head Attention (MHA), if
            `num_key_value_heads=1` the model will use Multi Query Attention (MQA) otherwise GQA is used. When
            converting a multi-head checkpoint to a GQA checkpoint, each group key and value head should be constructed
            by meanpooling all the original heads within that group. For more details checkout [this
            paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf). If it is not specified, will default to
            `num_attention_heads`.
        hidden_act (`str` or `function`, *optional*, defaults to `"silu"`):
            The non-linear activation function (function or string) in the decoder.
        max_position_embeddings (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2048):
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with.
        initializer_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02):
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not the model should return the last key/values attentions (not used by all models). Only
            relevant if `config.is_decoder=True`.
        pad_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            Padding token id.
        bos_token_id (`int`, *optional*):
            Beginning of stream token id.
        eos_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 50279):
            End of stream token id.
        tie_word_embeddings (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to tie weight embeddings
        rope_theta (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 10000.0):
            The base period of the RoPE embeddings.
        rope_scaling (`Dict`, *optional*):
            Dictionary containing the scaling configuration for the RoPE embeddings. Currently supports two scaling
            strategies: linear and dynamic. Their scaling factor must be a float greater than 1. The expected format is
            `{"type": strategy name, "factor": scaling factor}`. When using this flag, don't update
            `max_position_embeddings` to the expected new maximum. See the following thread for more information on how
            these scaling strategies behave:
            https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14mrgpr/dynamically_scaled_rope_further_increases/. This is an
            experimental feature, subject to breaking API changes in future versions.
        attention_bias (`bool`, defaults to `False`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use a bias in the query, key, value and output projection layers during self-attention.
        attention_dropout (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.
        rms_norm_eps (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1e-05):
            The epsilon used by the rms normalization layers.

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import Olmo2Model, Olmo2Config

    >>> # Initializing a Olmo2 7B style configuration
    >>> configuration = Olmo2Config()

    >>> # Initializing a model from the Olmo2 7B style configuration
    >>> model = Olmo2Model(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```
    

## Olmo2Model

The bare Olmo2 Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`Olmo2Config`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Transformer decoder consisting of *config.num_hidden_layers* layers. Each layer is a [`Olmo2DecoderLayer`]

        config: Olmo2Config

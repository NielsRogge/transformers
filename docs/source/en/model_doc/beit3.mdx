# BEiT3

## Overview

The BEiT3 model was proposed in [BEiT3: Image as a Foreign Language: BEiT Pretraining for All Vision and Vision-Language
Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10442) by Wenhui Wang, Hangbo Bao, Li Dong, Johan Bjorck, Zhiliang Peng, Qiang Liu,
Kriti Aggarwal, Owais Khan Mohammed, Saksham Singhal, Subhojit Som, Furu Wei.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*A big convergence of language, vision, and multimodal pretraining is emerging. In this work, we introduce a
general-purpose multimodal foundation model BEiT-3, which achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance on both vision
and vision-language tasks. Specifically, we advance the big convergence from three aspects: backbone architecture,
pretraining task, and model scaling up. We introduce Multiway Transformers for general-purpose modeling, where the
modular architecture enables both deep fusion and modality-specific encoding. Based on the shared backbone, we perform
masked "language" modeling on images (Imglish), texts (English), and image-text pairs ("parallel sentences") in a
unified manner. Experimental results show that BEiT-3 obtains state-of-the-art performance on object detection (COCO),
semantic segmentation (ADE20K), image classification (ImageNet), visual reasoning (NLVR2), visual question answering
(VQAv2), image captioning (COCO), and cross-modal retrieval (Flickr30K, COCO).*

# KOSMOS-2

## Overview

The KOSMOS-2 model was proposed in [Kosmos-2: Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models to the World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14824) by Zhiliang Peng, Wenhui Wang, Li Dong, Yaru Hao, Shaohan Huang, Shuming Ma, Furu Wei.

KOSMOS-2 is a Transformer-based causal language model and is trained using the next-word prediction task on a web-scale
dataset of grounded image-text pairs [GRIT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zzliang/GRIT). The spatial coordinates of
the bounding boxes in the dataset are converted to a sequence of location tokens, which are appended to their respective
entity text spans (for example, `a snowman` followed by `<patch_index_0044><patch_index_0863>`). The data format is
similar to “hyperlinks” that connect the object regions in an image to their text span in the corresponding caption.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We introduce Kosmos-2, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), enabling new capabilities of perceiving object descriptions (e.g., bounding boxes) and grounding text to the visual world. Specifically, we represent refer expressions as links in Markdown, i.e., ``[text span](bounding boxes)'', where object descriptions are sequences of location tokens. Together with multimodal corpora, we construct large-scale data of grounded image-text pairs (called GrIT) to train the model. In addition to the existing capabilities of MLLMs (e.g., perceiving general modalities, following instructions, and performing in-context learning), Kosmos-2 integrates the grounding capability into downstream applications. We evaluate Kosmos-2 on a wide range of tasks, including (i) multimodal grounding, such as referring expression comprehension, and phrase grounding, (ii) multimodal referring, such as referring expression generation, (iii) perception-language tasks, and (iv) language understanding and generation. This work lays out the foundation for the development of Embodiment AI and sheds light on the big convergence of language, multimodal perception, action, and world modeling, which is a key step toward artificial general intelligence.

## Example

```python
>>> from PIL import Image
>>> import requests
>>> from transformers import AutoProcessor, Kosmos2ForConditionalGeneration

>>> model = Kosmos2ForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained("microsoft/kosmos-2-patch14-224")
>>> processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("microsoft/kosmos-2-patch14-224")

>>> url = "https://huggingface.co/microsoft/kosmos-2-patch14-224/resolve/main/snowman.jpg"
>>> image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

>>> prompt = "<grounding> An image of"

>>> inputs = processor(text=prompt, images=image, return_tensors="pt")

>>> generated_ids = model.generate(
...     pixel_values=inputs["pixel_values"],
...     input_ids=inputs["input_ids"],
...     attention_mask=inputs["attention_mask"],
...     image_embeds=None,
...     image_embeds_position_mask=inputs["image_embeds_position_mask"],
...     use_cache=True,
...     max_new_tokens=64,
... )
>>> generated_text = processor.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
>>> processed_text = processor.post_process_generation(generated_text, cleanup_and_extract=False)
>>> processed_text
'<grounding> An image of<phrase> a snowman</phrase><object><patch_index_0044><patch_index_0863></object> warming himself by<phrase> a fire</phrase><object><patch_index_0005><patch_index_0911></object>.'

>>> caption, entities = processor.post_process_generation(generated_text)
>>> caption
'An image of a snowman warming himself by a fire.'

>>> entities
[('a snowman', (12, 21), [(0.390625, 0.046875, 0.984375, 0.828125)]), ('a fire', (41, 47), [(0.171875, 0.015625, 0.484375, 0.890625)])]

## Kosmos2Config


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`Kosmos2Model`]. It is used to instantiate a
    KOSMOS-2 model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the KOSMOS-2
    [microsoft/kosmos-2-patch14-224](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/kosmos-2-patch14-224) architecture.

    Args:
        text_config (`dict`, *optional*):
            Dictionary of configuration options used to initialize [`Kosmos2TextConfig`].
        vision_config (`dict`, *optional*):
            Dictionary of configuration options used to initialize [`Kosmos2VisionConfig`].
        latent_query_num (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 64):
            The number of latent query tokens that represent the image features used in the text decoder component.
        kwargs (*optional*):
            Dictionary of keyword arguments.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import Kosmos2Config, Kosmos2Model

    >>> # Initializing a Kosmos-2 kosmos-2-patch14-224 style configuration
    >>> configuration = Kosmos2Config()

    >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the kosmos-2-patch14-224 style configuration
    >>> model = Kosmos2Model(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## Kosmos2ImageProcessor

## Kosmos2Processor


    Constructs an KOSMOS-2 processor which wraps a KOSMOS-2 image processor and a KOSMOS-2 tokenizer into a single
    processor.

    [`Kosmos2Processor`] offers all the functionalities of [`CLIPImageProcessor`] and some functionalities of
    [`XLMRobertaTokenizerFast`]. See the docstring of [`~Kosmos2Processor.__call__`] and [`~Kosmos2Processor.decode`]
    for more information.

    Args:
        image_processor (`CLIPImageProcessor`):
            An instance of [`CLIPImageProcessor`]. The image processor is a required input.
        tokenizer (`XLMRobertaTokenizerFast`):
            An instance of ['XLMRobertaTokenizerFast`]. The tokenizer is a required input.
        num_patch_index_tokens (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1024):
            The number of tokens that represent patch indices.

## Kosmos2Model


    KOSMOS-2 Model for generating text and image features. The model consists of a vision encoder and a language model.
    
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`Kosmos2Config`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

# MobileNet V2

## Overview

The MobileNet model was proposed in [MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381) by Mark Sandler, Andrew Howard, Menglong Zhu, Andrey Zhmoginov, Liang-Chieh Chen.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In this paper we describe a new mobile architecture, MobileNetV2, that improves the state of the art performance of mobile models on multiple tasks and benchmarks as well as across a spectrum of different model sizes. We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3.*

*The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC image segmentation. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as the number of parameters.*

This model was contributed by [matthijs](https://huggingface.co/Matthijs). The original code and weights can be found [here for the main model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim/nets/mobilenet) and [here for DeepLabV3+](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/deeplab).

## Usage tips

- The checkpoints are named **mobilenet\_v2\_*depth*\_*size***, for example **mobilenet\_v2\_1.0\_224**, where **1.0** is the depth multiplier (sometimes also referred to as "alpha" or the width multiplier) and **224** is the resolution of the input images the model was trained on.

- Even though the checkpoint is trained on images of specific size, the model will work on images of any size. The smallest supported image size is 32x32.

- One can use [`MobileNetV2ImageProcessor`] to prepare images for the model.

- The available image classification checkpoints are pre-trained on [ImageNet-1k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/imagenet-1k) (also referred to as ILSVRC 2012, a collection of 1.3 million images and 1,000 classes). However, the model predicts 1001 classes: the 1000 classes from ImageNet plus an extra ‚Äúbackground‚Äù class (index 0).

- The segmentation model uses a [DeepLabV3+](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02611) head. The available semantic segmentation checkpoints are pre-trained on [PASCAL VOC](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/).

- The original TensorFlow checkpoints use different padding rules than PyTorch, requiring the model to determine the padding amount at inference time, since this depends on the input image size. To use native PyTorch padding behavior, create a [`MobileNetV2Config`] with `tf_padding = False`.

Unsupported features:

- The [`MobileNetV2Model`] outputs a globally pooled version of the last hidden state. In the original model it is possible to use an average pooling layer with a fixed 7x7 window and stride 1 instead of global pooling. For inputs that are larger than the recommended image size, this gives a pooled output that is larger than 1x1. The Hugging Face implementation does not support this.

- The original TensorFlow checkpoints include quantized models. We do not support these models as they include additional "FakeQuantization" operations to unquantize the weights.

- It's common to extract the output from the expansion layers at indices 10 and 13, as well as the output from the final 1x1 convolution layer, for downstream purposes. Using `output_hidden_states=True` returns the output from all intermediate layers. There is currently no way to limit this to specific layers.

- The DeepLabV3+ segmentation head does not use the final convolution layer from the backbone, but this layer gets computed anyway. There is currently no way to tell [`MobileNetV2Model`] up to which layer it should run.

## MobileNetV2Config


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`MobileNetV2Model`]. It is used to instantiate a
    MobileNetV2 model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
    configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the MobileNetV2
    [google/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224](https://huggingface.co/google/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Args:
        num_channels (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 3):
            The number of input channels.
        image_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 224):
            The size (resolution) of each image.
        depth_multiplier (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0):
            Shrinks or expands the number of channels in each layer. Default is 1.0, which starts the network with 32
            channels. This is sometimes also called "alpha" or "width multiplier".
        depth_divisible_by (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 8):
            The number of channels in each layer will always be a multiple of this number.
        min_depth (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 8):
            All layers will have at least this many channels.
        expand_ratio (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 6.0):
            The number of output channels of the first layer in each block is input channels times expansion ratio.
        output_stride (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):
            The ratio between the spatial resolution of the input and output feature maps. By default the model reduces
            the input dimensions by a factor of 32. If `output_stride` is 8 or 16, the model uses dilated convolutions
            on the depthwise layers instead of regular convolutions, so that the feature maps never become more than 8x
            or 16x smaller than the input image.
        first_layer_is_expansion (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            True if the very first convolution layer is also the expansion layer for the first expansion block.
        finegrained_output (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            If true, the number of output channels in the final convolution layer will stay large (1280) even if
            `depth_multiplier` is less than 1.
        hidden_act (`str` or `function`, *optional*, defaults to `"relu6"`):
            The non-linear activation function (function or string) in the Transformer encoder and convolution layers.
        tf_padding (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether to use TensorFlow padding rules on the convolution layers.
        classifier_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.8):
            The dropout ratio for attached classifiers.
        initializer_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02):
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        layer_norm_eps (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.001):
            The epsilon used by the layer normalization layers.
        semantic_loss_ignore_index (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 255):
            The index that is ignored by the loss function of the semantic segmentation model.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import MobileNetV2Config, MobileNetV2Model

    >>> # Initializing a "mobilenet_v2_1.0_224" style configuration
    >>> configuration = MobileNetV2Config()

    >>> # Initializing a model from the "mobilenet_v2_1.0_224" style configuration
    >>> model = MobileNetV2Model(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

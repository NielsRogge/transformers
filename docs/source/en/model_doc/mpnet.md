# MPNet

## Overview

The MPNet model was proposed in [MPNet: Masked and Permuted Pre-training for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09297) by Kaitao Song, Xu Tan, Tao Qin, Jianfeng Lu, Tie-Yan Liu.

MPNet adopts a novel pre-training method, named masked and permuted language modeling, to inherit the advantages of
masked language modeling and permuted language modeling for natural language understanding.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*BERT adopts masked language modeling (MLM) for pre-training and is one of the most successful pre-training models.
Since BERT neglects dependency among predicted tokens, XLNet introduces permuted language modeling (PLM) for
pre-training to address this problem. However, XLNet does not leverage the full position information of a sentence and
thus suffers from position discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose MPNet, a novel
pre-training method that inherits the advantages of BERT and XLNet and avoids their limitations. MPNet leverages the
dependency among predicted tokens through permuted language modeling (vs. MLM in BERT), and takes auxiliary position
information as input to make the model see a full sentence and thus reducing the position discrepancy (vs. PLM in
XLNet). We pre-train MPNet on a large-scale dataset (over 160GB text corpora) and fine-tune on a variety of
down-streaming tasks (GLUE, SQuAD, etc). Experimental results show that MPNet outperforms MLM and PLM by a large
margin, and achieves better results on these tasks compared with previous state-of-the-art pre-trained methods (e.g.,
BERT, XLNet, RoBERTa) under the same model setting.*

The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/MPNet).

## Usage tips

MPNet doesn't have `token_type_ids`, you don't need to indicate which token belongs to which segment. Just 
separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep_token` (or `[sep]`).

## MPNetConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`MPNetModel`] or a [`TFMPNetModel`]. It is used to
    instantiate a MPNet model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
    configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the MPNet
    [microsoft/mpnet-base](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/mpnet-base) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 30527):
            Vocabulary size of the MPNet model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`MPNetModel`] or [`TFMPNetModel`].
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 768):
            Dimensionality of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.
        num_hidden_layers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 12):
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer encoder.
        num_attention_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 12):
            Number of attention heads for each attention layer in the Transformer encoder.
        intermediate_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 3072):
            Dimensionality of the "intermediate" (often named feed-forward) layer in the Transformer encoder.
        hidden_act (`str` or `Callable`, *optional*, defaults to `"gelu"`):
            The non-linear activation function (function or string) in the encoder and pooler. If string, `"gelu"`,
            `"relu"`, `"silu"` and `"gelu_new"` are supported.
        hidden_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):
            The dropout probability for all fully connected layers in the embeddings, encoder, and pooler.
        attention_probs_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):
            The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.
        max_position_embeddings (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 512):
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with. Typically set this to something large
            just in case (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).
        initializer_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02):
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        layer_norm_eps (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1e-12):
            The epsilon used by the layer normalization layers.
        relative_attention_num_buckets (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):
            The number of buckets to use for each attention layer.

    Examples:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import MPNetModel, MPNetConfig

    >>> # Initializing a MPNet mpnet-base style configuration
    >>> configuration = MPNetConfig()

    >>> # Initializing a model from the mpnet-base style configuration
    >>> model = MPNetModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## MPNetTokenizer



    This tokenizer inherits from [`BertTokenizer`] which contains most of the methods. Users should refer to the
    superclass for more information regarding methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            Path to the vocabulary file.
        do_lower_case (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to lowercase the input when tokenizing.
        do_basic_tokenize (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to do basic tokenization before WordPiece.
        never_split (`Iterable`, *optional*):
            Collection of tokens which will never be split during tokenization. Only has an effect when
            `do_basic_tokenize=True`
        bos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The beginning of sequence token that was used during pre-training. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
            sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

            </Tip>

        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.
            The token used is the `sep_token`.

            </Tip>

        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[UNK]"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<mask>"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
        tokenize_chinese_chars (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to tokenize Chinese characters.

            This should likely be deactivated for Japanese (see this
            [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/328)).
        strip_accents (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to strip all accents. If this option is not specified, then it will be determined by the
            value for `lowercase` (as in the original BERT).
        clean_up_tokenization_spaces (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to cleanup spaces after decoding, cleanup consists in removing potential artifacts like
            extra spaces.

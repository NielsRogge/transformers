# MarkupLM

## Overview

The MarkupLM model was proposed in [MarkupLM: Pre-training of Text and Markup Language for Visually-rich Document
Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08518) by Junlong Li, Yiheng Xu, Lei Cui, Furu Wei. MarkupLM is BERT, but
applied to HTML pages instead of raw text documents.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Multimodal pre-training with text, layout, and image has made significant progress for Visually-rich Document
Understanding (VrDU), especially the fixed-layout documents such as scanned document images. While, there are still a
large number of digital documents where the layout information is not fixed and needs to be interactively and
dynamically rendered for visualization, making existing layout-based pre-training approaches not easy to apply. In this
paper, we propose MarkupLM for document understanding tasks with markup languages as the backbone such as
HTML/XML-based documents, where text and markup information is jointly pre-trained. Experiment results show that the
pre-trained MarkupLM significantly outperforms the existing strong baseline models on several document understanding
tasks. The pre-trained model and code will be publicly available.*

This model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/markuplm).

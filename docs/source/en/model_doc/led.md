# LED

## Overview

The LED model was proposed in [Longformer: The Long-Document Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150) by Iz
Beltagy, Matthew E. Peters, Arman Cohan.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales
quadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention
mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or
longer. Longformer's attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local
windowed attention with a task motivated global attention. Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we
evaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8. In
contrast to most prior work, we also pretrain Longformer and finetune it on a variety of downstream tasks. Our
pretrained Longformer consistently outperforms RoBERTa on long document tasks and sets new state-of-the-art results on
WikiHop and TriviaQA. We finally introduce the Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED), a Longformer variant for supporting
long document generative sequence-to-sequence tasks, and demonstrate its effectiveness on the arXiv summarization
dataset.*

## Usage tips

- [`LEDForConditionalGeneration`] is an extension of
  [`BartForConditionalGeneration`] exchanging the traditional *self-attention* layer with
  *Longformer*'s *chunked self-attention* layer. [`LEDTokenizer`] is an alias of
  [`BartTokenizer`].
- LED works very well on long-range *sequence-to-sequence* tasks where the `input_ids` largely exceed a length of
  1024 tokens.
- LED pads the `input_ids` to be a multiple of `config.attention_window` if required. Therefore a small speed-up is
  gained, when [`LEDTokenizer`] is used with the `pad_to_multiple_of` argument.
- LED makes use of *global attention* by means of the `global_attention_mask` (see
  [`LongformerModel`]). For summarization, it is advised to put *global attention* only on the first
  `<s>` token. For question answering, it is advised to put *global attention* on all tokens of the question.
- To fine-tune LED on all 16384, *gradient checkpointing* can be enabled in case training leads to out-of-memory (OOM)
  errors. This can be done by executing `model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()`. 
 Moreover, the `use_cache=False`
  flag can be used to disable the caching mechanism to save memory.
- LED is a model with absolute position embeddings so it's usually advised to pad the inputs on the right rather than
  the left.

## LEDConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`LEDModel`]. It is used to instantiate an LED
    model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
    defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the LED
    [allenai/led-base-16384](https://huggingface.co/allenai/led-base-16384) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## LEDTokenizer


    Constructs a LED tokenizer, which is smilar to the ROBERTa tokenizer, using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will
    be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import LEDTokenizer

    >>> tokenizer = LEDTokenizer.from_pretrained("allenai/led-base-16384")
    >>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 31414, 232, 2]

    >>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 20920, 232, 2]
    ```

    You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
    call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

    <Tip>

    When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer will add a space before each word (even the first one).

    </Tip>

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:

            Path to the vocabulary file.
        merges_file (`str`):
            Path to the merges file.

            Paradigm to follow when decoding bytes to UTF-8. See
            [bytes.decode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode) for more information.
        bos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
            sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

            </Tip>

        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.
            The token used is the `sep_token`.

            </Tip>

        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<mask>"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
        add_prefix_space (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add an initial space to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as any
            other word. (BART tokenizer detect beginning of words by the preceding space).
    

Methods: build_inputs_with_special_tokens
    - get_special_tokens_mask
    - create_token_type_ids_from_sequences
    - save_vocabulary

## LEDTokenizerFast


    Construct a "fast" LED tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's *tokenizers* library), derived from the GPT-2 tokenizer,
    using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will
    be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import LEDTokenizerFast

    >>> tokenizer = LEDTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("allenai/led-base-16384")
    >>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 31414, 232, 2]

    >>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 20920, 232, 2]
    ```

    You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
    call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

    <Tip>

    When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer needs to be instantiated with `add_prefix_space=True`.

## LED specific outputs

models.led.modeling_led.LEDEncoderBaseModelOutput

    Base class for LEDEncoder's outputs, with potential hidden states, local and global attentions.

    Args:

        hidden_states (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_hidden_states=True` is passed or when `config.output_hidden_states=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for the output of the embeddings + one for the output of each layer) of
            shape `(batch_size, sequence_length, hidden_size)`.

            Hidden-states of the model at the output of each layer plus the initial embedding outputs.
        attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, x +
            attention_window + 1)`, where `x` is the number of tokens with global attention mask.

            Local attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
            self-attention heads. Those are the attention weights from every token in the sequence to every token with
            global attention (first `x` values) and to every token in the attention window (remaining `attention_window
            + 1` values). Note that the first `x` values refer to tokens with fixed positions in the text, but the
            remaining `attention_window + 1` values refer to tokens with relative positions: the attention weight of a
            token to itself is located at index `x + attention_window / 2` and the `attention_window / 2` preceding
            (succeeding) values are the attention weights to the `attention_window / 2` preceding (succeeding) tokens.
            If the attention window contains a token with global attention, the attention weight at the corresponding
            index is set to 0; the value should be accessed from the first `x` attention weights. If a token has global
            attention, the attention weights to all other tokens in `attentions` is set to 0, the values should be
            accessed from `global_attentions`.
        global_attentions (`tuple(torch.FloatTensor)`, *optional*, returned when `output_attentions=True` is passed or when `config.output_attentions=True`):
            Tuple of `torch.FloatTensor` (one for each layer) of shape `(batch_size, num_heads, sequence_length, x)`,
            where `x` is the number of tokens with global attention mask.

            Global attentions weights after the attention softmax, used to compute the weighted average in the
            self-attention heads. Those are the attention weights from every token with global attention to every token
            in the sequence.

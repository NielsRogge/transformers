# DeBERTa

## Overview

The DeBERTa model was proposed in [DeBERTa: Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03654) by Pengcheng He, Xiaodong Liu, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen It is based on Google's
BERT model released in 2018 and Facebook's RoBERTa model released in 2019.

It builds on RoBERTa with disentangled attention and enhanced mask decoder training with half of the data used in
RoBERTa.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Recent progress in pre-trained neural language models has significantly improved the performance of many natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with
disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the
disentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and
position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their
contents and relative positions. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to replace the output softmax layer to
predict the masked tokens for model pretraining. We show that these two techniques significantly improve the efficiency
of model pretraining and performance of downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of
the training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9%
(90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). The DeBERTa code and
pre-trained models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa.*

## DebertaConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`DebertaModel`] or a [`TFDebertaModel`]. It is
    used to instantiate a DeBERTa model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
    Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the DeBERTa
    [microsoft/deberta-base](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/deberta-base) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Arguments:

            Vocabulary size of the DeBERTa model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the

            are supported.

    >>> from transformers import DebertaConfig, DebertaModel

    >>> # Initializing a DeBERTa microsoft/deberta-base style configuration
    >>> configuration = DebertaConfig()

    >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the microsoft/deberta-base style configuration
    >>> model = DebertaModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## DebertaTokenizer


    Construct a DeBERTa tokenizer. Based on byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will
    be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import DebertaTokenizer

    >>> tokenizer = DebertaTokenizer.from_pretrained("microsoft/deberta-base")
    >>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [1, 31414, 232, 2]

    >>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [1, 20920, 232, 2]
    ```

    You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
    call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

    <Tip>

    When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer will add a space before each word (even the first one).

    </Tip>

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            Path to the vocabulary file.
        merges_file (`str`):
            Path to the merges file.
        errors (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"replace"`):
            Paradigm to follow when decoding bytes to UTF-8. See
            [bytes.decode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode) for more information.
        bos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[CLS]"`):
            The beginning of sequence token.
        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[SEP]"`):
            The end of sequence token.
        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[SEP]"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[CLS]"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[UNK]"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[PAD]"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[MASK]"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
        add_prefix_space (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add an initial space to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as any
            other word. (Deberta tokenizer detect beginning of words by the preceding space).
        add_bos_token (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add an initial <|endoftext|> to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as
            any other word.

    - get_special_tokens_mask
    - create_token_type_ids_from_sequences
    - save_vocabulary

## DebertaTokenizerFast


    Construct a "fast" DeBERTa tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's *tokenizers* library). Based on byte-level
    Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will
    be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import DebertaTokenizerFast

    >>> tokenizer = DebertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("microsoft/deberta-base")
    >>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [1, 31414, 232, 2]

    >>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [1, 20920, 232, 2]
    ```

    You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer, but since
    the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

    <Tip>

    When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer needs to be instantiated with `add_prefix_space=True`.

    </Tip>

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should

            Path to the merges file.
        tokenizer_file (`str`, *optional*):
            The path to a tokenizer file to use instead of the vocab file.
        errors (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"replace"`):
            Paradigm to follow when decoding bytes to UTF-8. See
            [bytes.decode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode) for more information.
        bos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[CLS]"`):

# RegNet

## Overview

The RegNet model was proposed in [Designing Network Design Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13678) by Ilija Radosavovic, Raj Prateek Kosaraju, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He, Piotr Dollár.

The authors design search spaces to perform Neural Architecture Search (NAS). They first start from a high dimensional search space and iteratively reduce the search space by empirically applying constraints based on the best-performing models sampled by the current search space.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In this work, we present a new network design paradigm. Our goal is to help advance the understanding of network design and discover design principles that generalize across settings. Instead of focusing on designing individual network instances, we design network design spaces that parametrize populations of networks. The overall process is analogous to classic manual design of networks, but elevated to the design space level. Using our methodology we explore the structure aspect of network design and arrive at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple, regular networks that we call RegNet. The core insight of the RegNet parametrization is surprisingly simple: widths and depths of good networks can be explained by a quantized linear function. We analyze the RegNet design space and arrive at interesting findings that do not match the current practice of network design. The RegNet design space provides simple and fast networks that work well across a wide range of flop regimes. Under comparable training settings and flops, the RegNet models outperform the popular EfficientNet models while being up to 5x faster on GPUs.*

was contributed by [sayakpaul](https://huggingface.co/sayakpaul) and [ariG23498](https://huggingface.co/ariG23498).

The huge 10B model from [Self-supervised Pretraining of Visual Features in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01988), 
trained on  one billion Instagram images, is available on the [hub](https://huggingface.co/facebook/regnet-y-10b-seer)

## RegNetConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`RegNetModel`]. It is used to instantiate a RegNet
    model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
    defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the RegNet
    [facebook/regnet-y-040](https://huggingface.co/facebook/regnet-y-040) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Args:
        num_channels (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 3):
            The number of input channels.
        embedding_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 64):
            Dimensionality (hidden size) for the embedding layer.
        hidden_sizes (`List[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[256, 512, 1024, 2048]`):
            Dimensionality (hidden size) at each stage.
        depths (`List[int]`, *optional*, defaults to `[3, 4, 6, 3]`):
            Depth (number of layers) for each stage.
        layer_type (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"y"`):
            The layer to use, it can be either `"x" or `"y"`. An `x` layer is a ResNet's BottleNeck layer with
            `reduction` fixed to `1`. While a `y` layer is a `x` but with squeeze and excitation. Please refer to the
            paper for a detailed explanation of how these layers were constructed.
        hidden_act (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"relu"`):
            The non-linear activation function in each block. If string, `"gelu"`, `"relu"`, `"selu"` and `"gelu_new"`
            are supported.
        downsample_in_first_stage (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            If `True`, the first stage will downsample the inputs using a `stride` of 2.

    Example:
    ```python
    >>> from transformers import RegNetConfig, RegNetModel

    >>> # Initializing a RegNet regnet-y-40 style configuration
    >>> configuration = RegNetConfig()
    >>> # Initializing a model from the regnet-y-40 style configuration
    >>> model = RegNetModel(configuration)
    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## RegNetModel

The bare RegNet model outputting raw features without any specific head on top.
    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it
    as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matters related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`RegNetConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

## RegNetForImageClassification


    RegNet Model with an image classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the pooled features), e.g. for
    ImageNet.
    
    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it
    as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matters related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`RegNetConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

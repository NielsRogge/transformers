# SwitchTransformers

## Overview

The SwitchTransformers model was proposed in [Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961) by William Fedus, Barret Zoph, Noam Shazeer.

The Switch Transformer model uses a sparse T5 encoder-decoder architecture, where the MLP are replaced by a Mixture of Experts (MoE). A routing mechanism (top 1 in this case) associates each token to one of the expert, where each expert is a dense MLP. While switch transformers have a lot more weights than their equivalent dense models, the sparsity allows better scaling and better finetuning performance at scale.
During a forward pass, only a fraction of the weights are used. The routing mechanism allows the model to select relevant weights on the fly which increases the model capacity without increasing the number of operations.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the "Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.*

This model was contributed by [Younes Belkada](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada) and [Arthur Zucker](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ).

## Usage tips

- SwitchTransformers uses the [`T5Tokenizer`], which can be loaded directly from each model's repository.
- The released weights are pretrained on English [Masked Language Modeling](https://moon-ci-docs.huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pr_19323/en/glossary#general-terms) task, and should be finetuned.

## SwitchTransformersConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`SwitchTransformersModel`]. It is used to
    instantiate a SwitchTransformers model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
    Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the
    SwitchTransformers [google/switch-base-8](https://huggingface.co/google/switch-base-8) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Arguments:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32128):
            Vocabulary size of the SwitchTransformers model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be
            represented by the `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`SwitchTransformersModel`].
        d_model (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 768):
            Size of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.
        d_kv (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 64):
            Size of the key, query, value projections per attention head. `d_kv` has to be equal to `d_model //

        router_dtype (`str`, *optional*, default to `"float32"`):

            *selective precision* discussion in [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961).
        router_ignore_padding_tokens (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):

            Type of feed forward layer to be used. Should be one of `"relu"` or `"gated-gelu"`. SwitchTransformersv1.1
            uses the `"gated-gelu"` feed forward projection. Original SwitchTransformers uses `"relu"`.

## SwitchTransformersTop1Router


    Router using tokens choose top-1 experts assignment.

    This router uses the same mechanism as in Switch Transformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03961) and V-MoE
    (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05974): tokens choose their top experts. Items are sorted by router_probs and then
    routed to their choice of expert until the expert's expert_capacity is reached. **There is no guarantee that each
    token is processed by an expert**, or that each expert receives at least one token.

    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`SwitchTransformersConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the

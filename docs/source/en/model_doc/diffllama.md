# DiffLlama

## Overview

The DiffLlama model was proposed in [Differential Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05258) by Kazuma Matsumoto and .
This model is combine Llama model and Differential Transformer's Attention.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.*

### Usage tips
The hyperparameters of this model is the same as Llama model.


## DiffLlamaConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`DiffLlamaModel`]. It is used to instantiate an DiffLlama
    model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the defaults
    will yield a similar configuration to that of the [kajuma/DiffLlama-0.3B-handcut](https://huggingface.co/kajuma/DiffLlama-0.3B-handcut).

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.


    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32000):
            Vocabulary size of the DiffLlama model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`DiffLlamaModel`]
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2048):
            Dimension of the hidden representations.
        intermediate_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 8192):
            Dimension of the MLP representations.
        num_hidden_layers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 16):
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer decoder.
        num_attention_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):

        num_key_value_heads (`int`, *optional*):
            This is the number of key_value heads that should be used to implement Grouped Query Attention. If
            `num_key_value_heads=num_attention_heads`, the model will use Multi Head Attention (MHA), if
            `num_key_value_heads=1` the model will use Multi Query Attention (MQA) otherwise GQA is used. When
            converting a multi-head checkpoint to a GQA checkpoint, each group key and value head should be constructed
            by meanpooling all the original heads within that group. For more details checkout [this
            paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf). If it is not specified, will default to
            `num_attention_heads`.

## DiffLlamaModel

The bare DiffLlama Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`DiffLlamaConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Transformer decoder consisting of *config.num_hidden_layers* layers. Each layer is a [`DiffLlamaDecoderLayer`]

## DiffLlamaForSequenceClassification


    The DiffLlama Model transformer with a sequence classification head on top (linear layer).

    [`DiffLlamaForSequenceClassification`] uses the last token in order to do the classification, as other causal models
    (e.g. GPT-2) do.

    Since it does classification on the last token, it requires to know the position of the last token. If a
    `pad_token_id` is defined in the configuration, it finds the last token that is not a padding token in each row. If
    no `pad_token_id` is defined, it simply takes the last value in each row of the batch. Since it cannot guess the
    padding tokens when `inputs_embeds` are passed instead of `input_ids`, it does the same (take the last value in
    each row of the batch).
    
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

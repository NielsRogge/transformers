# Swin Transformer

## Overview

The Swin Transformer was proposed in [Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030)
by Ze Liu, Yutong Lin, Yue Cao, Han Hu, Yixuan Wei, Zheng Zhang, Stephen Lin, Baining Guo.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone
for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains,
such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text.
To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \bold{S}hifted
\bold{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping
local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at
various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it
compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense
prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation
(53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and
+2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones.
The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.*

This model was contributed by [novice03](https://huggingface.co/novice03). The Tensorflow version of this model was contributed by [amyeroberts](https://huggingface.co/amyeroberts). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer).

## Usage tips

- Swin pads the inputs supporting any input height and width (if divisible by `32`).
- Swin can be used as a *backbone*. When `output_hidden_states = True`, it will output both `hidden_states` and `reshaped_hidden_states`. The `reshaped_hidden_states` have a shape of `(batch, num_channels, height, width)` rather than `(batch_size, sequence_length, num_channels)`.

## SwinConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`SwinModel`]. It is used to instantiate a Swin
    model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
    defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Swin
    [microsoft/swin-tiny-patch4-window7-224](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/swin-tiny-patch4-window7-224)
    architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

## SwinModel

The bare Swin Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
    it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`SwinConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

        add_pooling_layer (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
                Whether or not to apply pooling layer.
        use_mask_token (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
                Whether or not to create and apply mask tokens in the embedding layer.

    <Tip>

    Note that we provide a script to pre-train this model on custom data in our [examples
    directory](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/image-pretraining).

## SwinForImageClassification


    Swin Model transformer with an image classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the final hidden state of
    the [CLS] token) e.g. for ImageNet.

    <Tip>

        Note that it's possible to fine-tune Swin on higher resolution images than the ones it has been trained on, by
        setting `interpolate_pos_encoding` to `True` in the forward of the model. This will interpolate the pre-trained
        position embeddings to the higher resolution.

    behavior.

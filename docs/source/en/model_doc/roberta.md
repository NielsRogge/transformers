## Overview

The RoBERTa model was proposed in [RoBERTa: A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692) by Yinhan Liu, [Myle Ott](https://huggingface.co/myleott), Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Mandar Joshi, Danqi Chen, Omer
Levy, Mike Lewis, Luke Zettlemoyer, Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Google's BERT model released in 2018.

It builds on BERT and modifies key hyperparameters, removing the next-sentence pretraining objective and training with
much larger mini-batches and learning rates.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Language model pretraining has led to significant performance gains but careful comparison between different
approaches is challenging. Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes,
and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication
study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and
training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every
model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results
highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently
reported improvements. We release our models and code.*

This model was contributed by [julien-c](https://huggingface.co/julien-c). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/roberta).

## Usage tips

- This implementation is the same as [`BertModel`] with a minor tweak to the embeddings, as well as a setup
  for RoBERTa pretrained models.
- RoBERTa has the same architecture as BERT but uses a byte-level BPE as a tokenizer (same as GPT-2) and uses a
  different pretraining scheme.
- RoBERTa doesn't have `token_type_ids`, so you don't need to indicate which token belongs to which segment. Just
  separate your segments with the separation token `tokenizer.sep_token` (or `</s>`).
- RoBERTa is similar to BERT but with better pretraining techniques:

    * Dynamic masking: tokens are masked differently at each epoch, whereas BERT does it once and for all.
    * Sentence packing: Sentences are packed together to reach 512 tokens (so the sentences are in an order that may span several documents).
    * Larger batches: Training uses larger batches.
    * Byte-level BPE vocabulary: Uses BPE with bytes as a subunit instead of characters, accommodating Unicode characters.
- [CamemBERT](camembert) is a wrapper around RoBERTa. Refer to its model page for usage examples.

## RobertaConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`RobertaModel`] or a [`TFRobertaModel`]. It is
    used to instantiate a RoBERTa model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
    Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the RoBERTa
    [FacebookAI/roberta-base](https://huggingface.co/FacebookAI/roberta-base) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

            `"relu"`, `"silu"` and `"gelu_new"` are supported.
        hidden_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):
            The dropout probability for all fully connected layers in the embeddings, encoder, and pooler.

    >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the configuration
    >>> model = RobertaModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## RobertaTokenizer


    Constructs a RoBERTa tokenizer, derived from the GPT-2 tokenizer, using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will
    be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import RobertaTokenizer

    >>> tokenizer = RobertaTokenizer.from_pretrained("FacebookAI/roberta-base")
    >>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 31414, 232, 2]

    >>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 20920, 232, 2]
    ```

    You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
    call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

    <Tip>

    When used with `is_split_into_words=True`, this tokenizer will add a space before each word (even the first one).

    </Tip>

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            Path to the vocabulary file.
        merges_file (`str`):
            Path to the merges file.
        errors (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"replace"`):
            Paradigm to follow when decoding bytes to UTF-8. See
            [bytes.decode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode) for more information.
        bos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
            sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

            </Tip>

        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.
            The token used is the `sep_token`.

            </Tip>

        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<mask>"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
        add_prefix_space (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add an initial space to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as any
            other word. (RoBERTa tokenizer detect beginning of words by the preceding space).

## RobertaTokenizerFast


    Construct a "fast" RoBERTa tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's *tokenizers* library), derived from the GPT-2
    tokenizer, using byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens (a bit like sentencepiece) so a word will
    be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import RobertaTokenizerFast

    >>> tokenizer = RobertaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("FacebookAI/roberta-base")
    >>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 31414, 232, 2]

    >>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [0, 20920, 232, 2]
    ```

    You can get around that behavior by passing `add_prefix_space=True` when instantiating this tokenizer or when you
    call it on some text, but since the model was not pretrained this way, it might yield a decrease in performance.

    <Tip>

## RobertaModel

The bare RoBERTa Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`RobertaConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.


    The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
    cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
    all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
    Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

    To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set
    to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and
    `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`RobertaConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

## RobertaForMultipleChoice


    Roberta Model with a multiple choice classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the pooled output and a
    softmax) e.g. for RocStories/SWAG tasks.
    

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`RobertaConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

## RobertaForTokenClassification


    Roberta Model with a token classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output) e.g. for
    Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) tasks.
    

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`RobertaConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

## RobertaForQuestionAnswering


    Roberta Model with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like SQuAD (a linear
    layers on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).
    

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`RobertaConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

# XLM-RoBERTa-XL

## Overview

The XLM-RoBERTa-XL model was proposed in [Larger-Scale Transformers for Multilingual Masked Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00572) by Naman Goyal, Jingfei Du, Myle Ott, Giri Anantharaman, Alexis Conneau. 

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-lingual language model pretraining for cross-lingual understanding. In this study, we present the results of two larger multilingual masked language models, with 3.5B and 10.7B parameters. Our two new models dubbed XLM-R XL and XLM-R XXL outperform XLM-R by 1.8% and 2.4% average accuracy on XNLI. Our model also outperforms the RoBERTa-Large model on several English tasks of the GLUE benchmark by 0.3% on average while handling 99 more languages. This suggests pretrained models with larger capacity may obtain both strong performance on high-resource languages while greatly improving low-resource languages. We make our code and models publicly available.*

This model was contributed by [Soonhwan-Kwon](https://github.com/Soonhwan-Kwon) and [stefan-it](https://huggingface.co/stefan-it). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/master/examples/xlmr).

## Usage tips

XLM-RoBERTa-XL is a multilingual model trained on 100 different languages. Unlike some XLM multilingual models, it does 
not require `lang` tensors to understand which language is used, and should be able to determine the correct 
language from the input ids.

## XLMRobertaXLConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`XLMRobertaXLModel`] or a [`TFXLMRobertaXLModel`].
    It is used to instantiate a XLM_ROBERTA_XL model according to the specified arguments, defining the model
    architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the
    XLM_ROBERTA_XL [facebook/xlm-roberta-xl](https://huggingface.co/facebook/xlm-roberta-xl) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.


    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 250880):
            Vocabulary size of the XLM_ROBERTA_XL model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented
            by the `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`XLMRobertaXLModel`].

            positional embeddings use `"absolute"`. For more information on `"relative_key"`, please refer to

    Examples:

    >>> configuration = XLMRobertaXLConfig()

    >>> # Initializing a model (with random weights) from the google-bert/bert-base-uncased style configuration
    >>> model = XLMRobertaXLModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## XLMRobertaXLModel

The bare XLM-RoBERTa-XL Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.) This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module)
    subclass. Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to
    general usage and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`XLMRobertaXLConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.


    The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
    cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
    all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
    Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

    To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set
    to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and
    `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

# RetriBERT

<Tip warning={true}>

This model is in maintenance mode only, so we won't accept any new PRs changing its code.

If you run into any issues running this model, please reinstall the last version that supported this model: v4.30.0.
You can do so by running the following command: `pip install -U transformers==4.30.0`.

</Tip>

## Overview

The RetriBERT model was proposed in the blog post [Explain Anything Like I'm Five: A Model for Open Domain Long Form
Question Answering](https://yjernite.github.io/lfqa.html). RetriBERT is a small model that uses either a single or
pair of BERT encoders with lower-dimension projection for dense semantic indexing of text.

This model was contributed by [yjernite](https://huggingface.co/yjernite). Code to train and use the model can be
found [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research-projects/distillation).


## RetriBertConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`RetriBertModel`]. It is used to instantiate a
    RetriBertModel model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
    configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the RetriBERT
    [yjernite/retribert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/yjernite/retribert-base-uncased) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 30522):
            Vocabulary size of the RetriBERT model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by

        max_position_embeddings (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 512):
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with. Typically set this to something large
            just in case (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).
        type_vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2):

            Final dimension of the query and document representation after projection
    

## RetriBertTokenizer


    Constructs a RetriBERT tokenizer.

    [`RetriBertTokenizer`] is identical to [`BertTokenizer`] and runs end-to-end tokenization: punctuation splitting
    and wordpiece.

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer
    to: this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            File containing the vocabulary.
        do_lower_case (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to lowercase the input when tokenizing.
        do_basic_tokenize (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to do basic tokenization before WordPiece.
        never_split (`Iterable`, *optional*):
            Collection of tokens which will never be split during tokenization. Only has an effect when
            `do_basic_tokenize=True`
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[UNK]"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[SEP]"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[PAD]"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[CLS]"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[MASK]"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.
        tokenize_chinese_chars (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to tokenize Chinese characters. This should likely be deactivated for Japanese (see this
            [issue](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/328)).
        strip_accents (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not to strip all accents. If this option is not specified, then it will be determined by the
            value for `lowercase` (as in the original BERT).
    

## RetriBertTokenizerFast


    Construct a "fast" RetriBERT tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's *tokenizers* library).

    [`RetriBertTokenizerFast`] is identical to [`BertTokenizerFast`] and runs end-to-end tokenization: punctuation
    splitting and wordpiece.

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should
    refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

            token instead.
        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[SEP]"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[PAD]"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[CLS]"`):

            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[MASK]"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.

            whitespaces by the classic one.
        tokenize_chinese_chars (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to tokenize Chinese characters. This should likely be deactivated for Japanese (see [this

            Whether or not to strip all accents. If this option is not specified, then it will be determined by the
            value for `lowercase` (as in the original BERT).
        wordpieces_prefix (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"##"`):
            The prefix for subwords.
    

## RetriBertModel

Bert Based model to embed queries or document for document retrieval.

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`RetriBertConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

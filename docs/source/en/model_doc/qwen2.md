# Qwen2

## Overview

Qwen2 is the new model series of large language models from the Qwen team. Previously, we released the Qwen series, including Qwen2-0.5B, Qwen2-1.5B, Qwen2-7B, Qwen2-57B-A14B, Qwen2-72B, Qwen2-Audio, etc.

### Model Details

Qwen2 is a language model series including decoder language models of different model sizes. For each size, we release the base language model and the aligned chat model. It is based on the Transformer architecture with SwiGLU activation, attention QKV bias, group query attention, mixture of sliding window attention and full attention, etc. Additionally, we have an improved tokenizer adaptive to multiple natural languages and codes.


## Usage tips

`Qwen2-7B` and `Qwen2-7B-Instruct` can be found on the [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/Qwen)

In the following, we demonstrate how to use `Qwen2-7B-Instruct` for the inference. Note that we have used the ChatML format for dialog, in this demo we show how to leverage `apply_chat_template` for this purpose.

```python
>>> from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
>>> device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

>>> model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct", device_map="auto")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct")

>>> prompt = "Give me a short introduction to large language model."

>>> messages = [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]

>>> text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)

>>> model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(device)

>>> generated_ids = model.generate(model_inputs.input_ids, max_new_tokens=512, do_sample=True)

>>> generated_ids = [output_ids[len(input_ids):] for input_ids, output_ids in zip(model_inputs.input_ids, generated_ids)]

>>> response = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)[0]
```

## Qwen2Config


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`Qwen2Model`]. It is used to instantiate a
    Qwen2 model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of
    Qwen2-7B-beta [Qwen/Qwen2-7B-beta](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2-7B-beta).

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.


    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 151936):
            Vocabulary size of the Qwen2 model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`Qwen2Model`]
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 4096):
            Dimension of the hidden representations.
        intermediate_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 22016):
            Dimension of the MLP representations.
        num_hidden_layers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):

        num_key_value_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32):
            This is the number of key_value heads that should be used to implement Grouped Query Attention. If
            `num_key_value_heads=num_attention_heads`, the model will use Multi Head Attention (MHA), if
            `num_key_value_heads=1` the model will use Multi Query Attention (MQA) otherwise GQA is used. When
            converting a multi-head checkpoint to a GQA checkpoint, each group key and value head should be constructed
            by meanpooling all the original heads within that group. For more details checkout [this
            paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf). If it is not specified, will default to `32`.
        hidden_act (`str` or `function`, *optional*, defaults to `"silu"`):

        rope_scaling (`Dict`, *optional*):
            Dictionary containing the scaling configuration for the RoPE embeddings. NOTE: if you apply new rope type
            and you expect the model to work on longer `max_position_embeddings`, we recommend you to update this value
            accordingly.
            Expected contents:
                `rope_type` (`str`):

                    Used with all rope types except 'default'. The scaling factor to apply to the RoPE embeddings. In
                    most scaling types, a `factor` of x will enable the model to handle sequences of length x *
                    original maximum pre-trained length.

                    size divided by the number of attention heads divided by 2
                `low_freq_factor` (`float`, *optional*):

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import Qwen2Model, Qwen2Config

    >>> # Initializing a Qwen2 style configuration
    >>> configuration = Qwen2Config()

    >>> # Initializing a model from the Qwen2-7B style configuration
    >>> model = Qwen2Model(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## Qwen2Tokenizer


    Construct a Qwen2 tokenizer. Based on byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    Same with GPT2Tokenizer, this tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens so a word will
    be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import Qwen2Tokenizer

    >>> tokenizer = Qwen2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-tokenizer")
    >>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [9707, 1879]

    >>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [21927, 1879]
    ```
    This is expected.

    You should not use GPT2Tokenizer instead, because of the different pretokenization rules.

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            Path to the vocabulary file.
        merges_file (`str`):
            Path to the merges file.
        errors (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"replace"`):
            Paradigm to follow when decoding bytes to UTF-8. See
            [bytes.decode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode) for more information.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<|endoftext|>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        bos_token (`str`, *optional*):
            The beginning of sequence token. Not applicable for this tokenizer.
        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<|endoftext|>"`):
            The end of sequence token.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<|endoftext|>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        clean_up_tokenization_spaces (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the model should cleanup the spaces that were added when splitting the input text during the
            tokenization process. Not applicable to this tokenizer, since tokenization does not add spaces.
        split_special_tokens (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the special tokens should be split during the tokenization process. The default behavior is
            to not split special tokens. This means that if `<|endoftext|>` is the `eos_token`, then `tokenizer.tokenize("<|endoftext|>") =
            ['<|endoftext|>`]. Otherwise, if `split_special_tokens=True`, then `tokenizer.tokenize("<|endoftext|>")` will be give `['<',
            '|', 'endo', 'ft', 'ext', '|', '>']`. This argument is only supported for `slow` tokenizers for the moment.

## Qwen2TokenizerFast


    Construct a "fast" Qwen2 tokenizer (backed by HuggingFace's *tokenizers* library). Based on byte-level
    Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    Same with GPT2Tokenizer, this tokenizer has been trained to treat spaces like parts of the tokens so a word will
    be encoded differently whether it is at the beginning of the sentence (without space) or not:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import Qwen2TokenizerFast

    >>> tokenizer = Qwen2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen-tokenizer")
    >>> tokenizer("Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [9707, 1879]

    >>> tokenizer(" Hello world")["input_ids"]
    [21927, 1879]
    ```
    This is expected.

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizerFast`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should
    refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`, *optional*):
            Path to the vocabulary file.
        merges_file (`str`, *optional*):
            Path to the merges file.
        tokenizer_file (`str`, *optional*):
            Path to [tokenizers](https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers) file (generally has a .json extension) that
            contains everything needed to load the tokenizer.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<|endoftext|>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead. Not applicable to this tokenizer.
        bos_token (`str`, *optional*):
            The beginning of sequence token. Not applicable for this tokenizer.
        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<|endoftext|>"`):
            The end of sequence token.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<|endoftext|>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
    

## Qwen2Model

The bare Qwen2 Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`Qwen2Config`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Transformer decoder consisting of *config.num_hidden_layers* layers. Each layer is a [`Qwen2DecoderLayer`]

    Args:
        config: Qwen2Config

## Qwen2ForCausalLM

No docstring available for Qwen2ForCausalLM

Methods: forward

## Qwen2ForSequenceClassification


    The Qwen2 Model transformer with a sequence classification head on top (linear layer).

    [`Qwen2ForSequenceClassification`] uses the last token in order to do the classification, as other causal models
    (e.g. GPT-2) do.

    Since it does classification on the last token, it requires to know the position of the last token. If a
    `pad_token_id` is defined in the configuration, it finds the last token that is not a padding token in each row. If
    no `pad_token_id` is defined, it simply takes the last value in each row of the batch. Since it cannot guess the
    padding tokens when `inputs_embeds` are passed instead of `input_ids`, it does the same (take the last value in
    each row of the batch).
    
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`Qwen2Config`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

SQuAD (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).
    
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads

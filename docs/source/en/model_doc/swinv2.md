# Swin Transformer V2

## Overview

The Swin Transformer V2 model was proposed in [Swin Transformer V2: Scaling Up Capacity and Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09883) by Ze Liu, Han Hu, Yutong Lin, Zhuliang Yao, Zhenda Xie, Yixuan Wei, Jia Ning, Yue Cao, Zheng Zhang, Li Dong, Furu Wei, Baining Guo.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Large-scale NLP models have been shown to significantly improve the performance on language tasks with no signs of saturation. They also demonstrate amazing few-shot capabilities like that of human beings. This paper aims to explore large-scale models in computer vision. We tackle three major issues in training and application of large vision models, including training instability, resolution gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, and hunger on labelled data. Three main techniques are proposed: 1) a residual-post-norm method combined with cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) A log-spaced continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with high-resolution inputs; 3) A self-supervised pre-training method, SimMIM, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images. Through these techniques, this paper successfully trained a 3 billion-parameter Swin Transformer V2 model, which is the largest dense vision model to date, and makes it capable of training with images of up to 1,536×1,536 resolution. It set new performance records on 4 representative vision tasks, including ImageNet-V2 image classification, COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, and Kinetics-400 video action classification. Also note our training is much more efficient than that in Google's billion-level visual models, which consumes 40 times less labelled data and 40 times less training time.*

## Swinv2Config


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`Swinv2Model`]. It is used to instantiate a Swin
    Transformer v2 model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
    configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Swin Transformer v2
    [microsoft/swinv2-tiny-patch4-window8-256](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/swinv2-tiny-patch4-window8-256)
    architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

## Swinv2Model

The bare Swinv2 Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
    it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`Swinv2Config`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.


Methods: forward

## Swinv2ForMaskedImageModeling

Swinv2 Model with a decoder on top for masked image modeling, as proposed in
[SimMIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09886).

    <Tip>

    Note that we provide a script to pre-train this model on custom data in our [examples
    directory](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/pytorch/image-pretraining).

Methods: forward

## Swinv2ForImageClassification


    Swinv2 Model transformer with an image classification head on top (a linear layer on top of the final hidden state
    of the [CLS] token) e.g. for ImageNet.

    <Tip>

        Note that it's possible to fine-tune SwinV2 on higher resolution images than the ones it has been trained on, by
        setting `interpolate_pos_encoding` to `True` in the forward of the model. This will interpolate the pre-trained
        position embeddings to the higher resolution.

# Pixtral

## Overview

The Pixtral model was released by the Mistral AI team in a [blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/pixtral-12b/). Pixtral is a multimodal version of [Mistral](mistral), incorporating a 400 million parameter vision encoder trained from scratch.

The intro from the blog says the following:

*Pixtral is trained to understand both natural images and documents, achieving 52.5% on the MMMU reasoning benchmark, surpassing a number of larger models. The model shows strong abilities in tasks such as chart and figure understanding, document question answering, multimodal reasoning and instruction following. Pixtral is able to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio, giving the user flexibility on the number of tokens used to process an image. Pixtral is also able to process any number of images in its long context window of 128K tokens. Unlike previous open-source models, Pixtral does not compromise on text benchmark performance to excel in multimodal tasks.*

Tips:

- Pixtral is a multimodal model, taking images and text as input, and producing text as output.
- This model follows the [Llava](llava) architecture. The model uses [`PixtralVisionModel`] for its vision encoder, and [`MistralForCausalLM`] for its language decoder.
- The main contribution is the 2d ROPE (rotary position embeddings) on the images, and support for arbitrary image sizes (the images are not padded together nor are they resized).
- Similar to [Llava](llava), the model internally replaces the `[IMG]` token placeholders by image embeddings from the vision encoder. The format for one or multiple prompts is the following:
```
"<s>[INST][IMG]\nWhat are the things I should be cautious about when I visit this place?[/INST]"
```
Then, the processor will replace each `[IMG]` token with a number of `[IMG]` tokens that depend on the height and the width of each image. Each *row* of the image is separated by an `[IMG_BREAK]` token, and each image is separated by an `[IMG_END]` token. It's advised to use the `apply_chat_template` method of the processor, which takes care of all of this. See the [usage section](#usage) for more info.

This model was contributed by [amyeroberts](https://huggingface.co/amyeroberts) and [ArthurZ](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/8377).

## Usage

At inference time, it's advised to use the processor's `apply_chat_template` method, which correctly formats the prompt for the model:

```python
from transformers import AutoProcessor, LlavaForConditionalGeneration
from PIL import Image

model_id = "mistral-community/pixtral-12b"
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = LlavaForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(model_id).to("cuda")

url_dog = "https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300"
url_mountain = "https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300"

chat = [
    {
      "role": "user", "content": [
        {"type": "text", "content": "Can this animal"}, 
        {"type": "image"}, 
        {"type": "text", "content": "live here?"}, 
        {"type": "image"}
      ]
    }
]

prompt = processor.apply_chat_template(chat)
inputs = processor(text=prompt, images=[url_dog, url_mountain], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
generate_ids = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=500)
output = processor.batch_decode(generate_ids, skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)[0]
```

## PixtralVisionConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`PixtralVisionModel`]. It is used to instantiate an
    Pixtral vision encoder according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to the vision encoder used by Pixtral-12B.

    e.g. [pixtral-hf/pixtral-9b](https://huggingface.co/pixtral-hf/pixtral-9b)

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Args:
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1024):
            Dimension of the hidden representations.
        intermediate_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 4096):
            Dimension of the MLP representations.
        num_hidden_layers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 24):
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer encoder.
        num_attention_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 16):
            Number of attention heads in the Transformer encoder.
        num_channels (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 3):
            Number of input channels in the input images.
        image_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1024):
            Max dimension of the input images.
        patch_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 16):
            Size of the image patches.
        hidden_act (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"gelu"`):
            Activation function used in the hidden layers.
        attention_dropout (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            Dropout probability for the attention layers.
        rope_theta (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 10000.0):
            The base period of the RoPE embeddings.
        initializer_range (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.02):
            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.

    Example:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import PixtralVisionModel, PixtralVisionConfig

    >>> # Initializing a Pixtral-12B style configuration
    >>> config = PixtralVisionConfig()

    >>> # Initializing a model (with randomly initialized weights) from the configuration
    >>> model = PixtralVisionModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## PixtralVisionModel

The bare Pixtral vision encoder outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`PixtralVisionConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the vision encoder. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

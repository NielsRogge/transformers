# LLaMA

## Overview

The LLaMA model was proposed in [LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971) by Hugo Touvron, Thibaut Lavril, Gautier Izacard, Xavier Martinet, Marie-Anne Lachaux, Timoth√©e Lacroix, Baptiste Rozi√®re, Naman Goyal, Eric Hambro, Faisal Azhar, Aurelien Rodriguez, Armand Joulin, Edouard Grave, Guillaume Lample. It is a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We introduce LLaMA, a collection of foundation language models ranging from 7B to 65B parameters. We train our models on trillions of tokens, and show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art models using publicly available datasets exclusively, without resorting to proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In particular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 (175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-65B is competitive with the best models, Chinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release all our models to the research community. *

This model was contributed by [zphang](https://huggingface.co/zphang) with contributions from [BlackSamorez](https://huggingface.co/BlackSamorez). The code of the implementation in Hugging Face is based on GPT-NeoX [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox). The original code of the authors can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama).

## Usage tips

- Weights for the LLaMA models can be obtained from by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqNECQnMkycAp2jP4Z9TFX0cGR4uf7b_fBxjY_OjhJILlKGA/viewform?usp=send_form)
- After downloading the weights, they will need to be converted to the Hugging Face Transformers format using the [conversion script](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/main/src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py). The script can be called with the following (example) command:

```bash
python src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py \
    --input_dir /path/to/downloaded/llama/weights --model_size 7B --output_dir /output/path
```

- After conversion, the model and tokenizer can be loaded via:

```python
from transformers import LlamaForCausalLM, LlamaTokenizer

tokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained("/output/path")
model = LlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/output/path")
```

Note that executing the script requires enough CPU RAM to host the whole model in float16 precision (even if the biggest versions
come in several checkpoints they each contain a part of each weight of the model, so we need to load them all in RAM). For the 65B model, it's thus 130GB of RAM needed.

- The LLaMA tokenizer is a BPE model based on [sentencepiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece). One quirk of sentencepiece is that when decoding a sequence, if the first token is the start of the word (e.g. "Banana"), the tokenizer does not prepend the prefix space to the string.

This model was contributed by [zphang](https://huggingface.co/zphang) with contributions from [BlackSamorez](https://huggingface.co/BlackSamorez). The code of the implementation in Hugging Face is based on GPT-NeoX [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/gpt-neox). The original code of the authors can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama). The Flax version of the implementation was contributed by [afmck](https://huggingface.co/afmck) with the code in the implementation based on Hugging Face's Flax GPT-Neo.


Based on the original LLaMA model, Meta AI has released some follow-up works:

- **Llama2**: Llama2 is an improved version of Llama with some architectural tweaks (Grouped Query Attention), and is pre-trained on 2Trillion tokens. Refer to the documentation of Llama2 which can be found [here](llama2).

## LlamaConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`LlamaModel`]. It is used to instantiate an LLaMA
    model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
    defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the LLaMA-7B.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.


    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 32000):
            Vocabulary size of the LLaMA model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`LlamaModel`]

            `num_key_value_heads=1` the model will use Multi Query Attention (MQA) otherwise GQA is used. When
            converting a multi-head checkpoint to a GQA checkpoint, each group key and value head should be constructed
            by meanpooling all the original heads within that group. For more details checkout [this
            paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf). If it is not specified, will default to

            Dictionary containing the scaling configuration for the RoPE embeddings. NOTE: if you apply new rope type
            and you expect the model to work on longer `max_position_embeddings`, we recommend you to update this value
            accordingly.
            Expected contents:

        sp_model_kwargs (`Dict[str, Any]`, `Optional`, *optional*):
            Will be passed to the `SentencePieceProcessor.__init__()` method. The [Python wrapper for
            SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/tree/master/python) can be used, among other things,
            to set:

            - `enable_sampling`: Enable subword regularization.
            - `nbest_size`: Sampling parameters for unigram. Invalid for BPE-Dropout.

              - `nbest_size = {0,1}`: No sampling is performed.
              - `nbest_size > 1`: samples from the nbest_size results.
              - `nbest_size < 0`: assuming that nbest_size is infinite and samples from the all hypothesis (lattice)
                using forward-filtering-and-backward-sampling algorithm.

            - `alpha`: Smoothing parameter for unigram sampling, and dropout probability of merge operations for
              BPE-dropout.

        add_bos_token (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to add an `bos_token` at the start of sequences.
        add_eos_token (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add an `eos_token` at the end of sequences.
        clean_up_tokenization_spaces (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to cleanup spaces after decoding, cleanup consists in removing potential artifacts like
            extra spaces.
        use_default_system_prompt (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the default system prompt for Llama should be used.
        spaces_between_special_tokens (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to add spaces between special tokens.
        legacy (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether or not the `legacy` behavior of the tokenizer should be used. Legacy is before the merge of #24622
            and #25224 which includes fixes to properly handle tokens that appear after special tokens.
            Make sure to also set `from_slow` to `True`.
            A simple example:

            - `legacy=True`:
            ```python
            >>> from transformers import LlamaTokenizerFast

            >>> tokenizer = LlamaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("huggyllama/llama-7b", legacy=True, from_slow=True)
            >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello <s>.") # 869 is '‚ñÅ.'
            [1, 15043, 29871, 1, 869]
            ```
            - `legacy=False`:
            ```python
            >>> from transformers import LlamaTokenizerFast

            >>> tokenizer = LlamaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("huggyllama/llama-7b", legacy=False, from_slow=True)
            >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello <s>.")  # 29889 is '.'
            [1, 15043, 29871, 1, 29889]
            ```
            Checkout the [pull request](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565) for more details.
        add_prefix_space (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not to add an initial space to the input. This allows to treat the leading word just as any
            other word. Again, this should be set with `from_slow=True` to make sure it's taken into account.
    

Methods: build_inputs_with_special_tokens
    - get_special_tokens_mask
    - create_token_type_ids_from_sequences
    - save_vocabulary

## LlamaTokenizerFast


    Construct a Llama tokenizer. Based on byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This uses notably ByteFallback and no normalization.

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import LlamaTokenizerFast

    >>> tokenizer = LlamaTokenizerFast.from_pretrained("hf-internal-testing/llama-tokenizer")
    >>> tokenizer.encode("Hello this is a test")
    [1, 15043, 445, 338, 263, 1243]
    ```

    If you want to change the `bos_token` or the `eos_token`, make sure to specify them when initializing the model, or
    call `tokenizer.update_post_processor()` to make sure that the post-processing is correctly done (otherwise the
    values of the first token and final token of an encoded sequence will not be correct). For more details, checkout
    [post-processors] (https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/api/post-processors) documentation.

## LlamaModel

The bare LLaMA Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`LlamaConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Transformer decoder consisting of *config.num_hidden_layers* layers. Each layer is a [`LlamaDecoderLayer`]

    Args:
        config: LlamaConfig

## LlamaForSequenceClassification


    The LLaMa Model transformer with a sequence classification head on top (linear layer).

    [`LlamaForSequenceClassification`] uses the last token in order to do the classification, as other causal models
    (e.g. GPT-2) do.

    Since it does classification on the last token, it requires to know the position of the last token. If a
    `pad_token_id` is defined in the configuration, it finds the last token that is not a padding token in each row. If
    no `pad_token_id` is defined, it simply takes the last value in each row of the batch. Since it cannot guess the
    padding tokens when `inputs_embeds` are passed instead of `input_ids`, it does the same (take the last value in
    each row of the batch).
    
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`LlamaConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

## LlamaForQuestionAnswering


The Llama Model transformer with a span classification head on top for extractive question-answering tasks like
SQuAD (a linear layer on top of the hidden-states output to compute `span start logits` and `span end logits`).
    
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`LlamaConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

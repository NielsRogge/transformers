# DINOv2

## Overview

The DINOv2 model was proposed in [DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193) by
Maxime Oquab, TimothÃ©e Darcet, ThÃ©o Moutakanni, Huy Vo, Marc Szafraniec, Vasil Khalidov, Pierre Fernandez, Daniel Haziza, Francisco Massa, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Mahmoud Assran, Nicolas Ballas, Wojciech Galuba, Russell Howes, Po-Yao Huang, Shang-Wen Li, Ishan Misra, Michael Rabbat, Vasu Sharma, Gabriel Synnaeve, Hu Xu, HervÃ© Jegou, Julien Mairal, Patrick Labatut, Armand Joulin, Piotr Bojanowski.
DINOv2 is an upgrade of [DINO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14294), a self-supervised method applied on [Vision Transformers](vit). This method enables all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*The recent breakthroughs in natural language processing for model pretraining on large quantities of data have opened the way for similar foundation models in computer vision. These models could greatly simplify the use of images in any system by producing all-purpose visual features, i.e., features that work across image distributions and tasks without finetuning. This work shows that existing pretraining methods, especially self-supervised methods, can produce such features if trained on enough curated data from diverse sources. We revisit existing approaches and combine different techniques to scale our pretraining in terms of data and model size. Most of the technical contributions aim at accelerating and stabilizing the training at scale. In terms of data, we propose an automatic pipeline to build a dedicated, diverse, and curated image dataset instead of uncurated data, as typically done in the self-supervised literature. In terms of models, we train a ViT model (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) with 1B parameters and distill it into a series of smaller models that surpass the best available all-purpose features, OpenCLIP (Ilharco et al., 2021) on most of the benchmarks at image and pixel levels.*

This model was contributed by [nielsr](https://huggingface.co/nielsr).
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2).

## Usage tips

The model can be traced using `torch.jit.trace` which leverages JIT compilation to optimize the model making it faster to run. Note this still produces some mis-matched elements and the difference between the original model and the traced model is of the order of 1e-4.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, AutoModel
from PIL import Image
import requests

url = 'http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg'
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained('facebook/dinov2-base')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('facebook/dinov2-base')

inputs = processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
last_hidden_states = outputs[0]

# We have to force return_dict=False for tracing
model.config.return_dict = False

with torch.no_grad():
    traced_model = torch.jit.trace(model, [inputs.pixel_values])
    traced_outputs = traced_model(inputs.pixel_values)

print((last_hidden_states - traced_outputs[0]).abs().max())
```

## Dinov2Config


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`Dinov2Model`]. It is used to instantiate an
    Dinov2 model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Dinov2
    [google/dinov2-base-patch16-224](https://huggingface.co/google/dinov2-base-patch16-224) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

## Dinov2Model

The bare DINOv2 Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass. Use it
    as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`Dinov2Config`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

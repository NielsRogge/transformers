# RT-DETR

## Overview


The RT-DETR model was proposed in [DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08069) by Wenyu Lv, Yian Zhao, Shangliang Xu, Jinman Wei, Guanzhong Wang, Cheng Cui, Yuning Du, Qingqing Dang, Yi Liu.

RT-DETR is an object detection model that stands for "Real-Time DEtection Transformer." This model is designed to perform object detection tasks with a focus on achieving real-time performance while maintaining high accuracy. Leveraging the transformer architecture, which has gained significant popularity in various fields of deep learning, RT-DETR processes images to identify and locate multiple objects within them.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Recently, end-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have achieved remarkable performance. However, the issue of the high computational cost of DETRs has not been effectively addressed, limiting their practical application and preventing them from fully exploiting the benefits of no post-processing, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS). In this paper, we first analyze the influence of NMS in modern real-time object detectors on inference speed, and establish an end-to-end speed benchmark. To avoid the inference delay caused by NMS, we propose a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR), the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge. Specifically, we design an efficient hybrid encoder to efficiently process multi-scale features by decoupling the intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion, and propose IoU-aware query selection to improve the initialization of object queries. In addition, our proposed detector supports flexibly adjustment of the inference speed by using different decoder layers without the need for retraining, which facilitates the practical application of real-time object detectors. Our RT-DETR-L achieves 53.0% AP on COCO val2017 and 114 FPS on T4 GPU, while RT-DETR-X achieves 54.8% AP and 74 FPS, outperforming all YOLO detectors of the same scale in both speed and accuracy. Furthermore, our RT-DETR-R50 achieves 53.1% AP and 108 FPS, outperforming DINO-Deformable-DETR-R50 by 2.2% AP in accuracy and by about 21 times in FPS.*

## Usage tips

Initially, an image is processed using a pre-trained convolutional neural network, specifically a Resnet-D variant as referenced in the original code. This network extracts features from the final three layers of the architecture. Following this, a hybrid encoder is employed to convert the multi-scale features into a sequential array of image features. Then, a decoder, equipped with auxiliary prediction heads is used to refine the object queries. This process facilitates the direct generation of bounding boxes, eliminating the need for any additional post-processing to acquire the logits and coordinates for the bounding boxes.

        do_resize (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Controls whether to resize the image's `(height, width)` dimensions to the specified `size`. Can be
            overridden by the `do_resize` parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        size (`Dict[str, int]` *optional*, defaults to `{"shortest_edge": 800, "longest_edge": 1333}`):
            Size of the image's `(height, width)` dimensions after resizing. Can be overridden by the `size` parameter
            in the `preprocess` method. Available options are:
                - `{"height": int, "width": int}`: The image will be resized to the exact size `(height, width)`.
                    Do NOT keep the aspect ratio.
                - `{"shortest_edge": int, "longest_edge": int}`: The image will be resized to a maximum size respecting
                    the aspect ratio and keeping the shortest edge less or equal to `shortest_edge` and the longest edge
                    less or equal to `longest_edge`.
                - `{"max_height": int, "max_width": int}`: The image will be resized to the maximum size respecting the
                    aspect ratio and keeping the height less or equal to `max_height` and the width less or equal to
                    `max_width`.
        resample (`PILImageResampling`, *optional*, defaults to `PILImageResampling.BILINEAR`):
            Resampling filter to use if resizing the image.
        do_rescale (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Controls whether to rescale the image by the specified scale `rescale_factor`. Can be overridden by the
            `do_rescale` parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        rescale_factor (`int` or `float`, *optional*, defaults to `1/255`):
            Scale factor to use if rescaling the image. Can be overridden by the `rescale_factor` parameter in the
            `preprocess` method.
        do_normalize (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Controls whether to normalize the image. Can be overridden by the `do_normalize` parameter in the
            `preprocess` method.
        image_mean (`float` or `List[float]`, *optional*, defaults to `IMAGENET_DEFAULT_MEAN`):
            Mean values to use when normalizing the image. Can be a single value or a list of values, one for each
            channel. Can be overridden by the `image_mean` parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        image_std (`float` or `List[float]`, *optional*, defaults to `IMAGENET_DEFAULT_STD`):
            Standard deviation values to use when normalizing the image. Can be a single value or a list of values, one
            for each channel. Can be overridden by the `image_std` parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        do_convert_annotations (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Controls whether to convert the annotations to the format expected by the RT_DETR model. Converts the
            bounding boxes to the format `(center_x, center_y, width, height)` and in the range `[0, 1]`.
            Can be overridden by the `do_convert_annotations` parameter in the `preprocess` method.
        do_pad (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Controls whether to pad the image. Can be overridden by the `do_pad` parameter in the `preprocess`
            method. If `True`, padding will be applied to the bottom and right of the image with zeros.
            If `pad_size` is provided, the image will be padded to the specified dimensions.
            Otherwise, the image will be padded to the maximum height and width of the batch.
        pad_size (`Dict[str, int]`, *optional*):
            The size `{"height": int, "width" int}` to pad the images to. Must be larger than any image size
            provided for preprocessing. If `pad_size` is not provided, images will be padded to the largest
            height and width in the batch.

## RTDetrModel


    RT-DETR Model (consisting of a backbone and encoder-decoder) outputting raw hidden states without any head on top.
    
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`RTDetrConfig`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads

    Parameters:
        config ([`RTDetrResNetConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.

# SEW

## Overview

SEW (Squeezed and Efficient Wav2Vec) was proposed in [Performance-Efficiency Trade-offs in Unsupervised Pre-training
for Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06870) by Felix Wu, Kwangyoun Kim, Jing Pan, Kyu Han, Kilian Q.
Weinberger, Yoav Artzi.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*This paper is a study of performance-efficiency trade-offs in pre-trained models for automatic speech recognition
(ASR). We focus on wav2vec 2.0, and formalize several architecture designs that influence both the model performance
and its efficiency. Putting together all our observations, we introduce SEW (Squeezed and Efficient Wav2vec), a
pre-trained model architecture with significant improvements along both performance and efficiency dimensions across a
variety of training setups. For example, under the 100h-960h semi-supervised setup on LibriSpeech, SEW achieves a 1.9x
inference speedup compared to wav2vec 2.0, with a 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate. With a similar inference
time, SEW reduces word error rate by 25-50% across different model sizes.*

This model was contributed by [anton-l](https://huggingface.co/anton-l).

## Usage tips

- SEW is a speech model that accepts a float array corresponding to the raw waveform of the speech signal.
- SEWForCTC is fine-tuned using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) so the model output has to be decoded using
  [`Wav2Vec2CTCTokenizer`].

## SEWConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`SEWModel`]. It is used to instantiate a SEW model
    according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
    defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the SEW
    [asapp/sew-tiny-100k](https://huggingface.co/asapp/sew-tiny-100k) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Yoav Artzi.

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving etc.).

    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
    it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`SEWConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the

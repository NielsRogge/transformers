# RF-DETR

[RF-DETR](https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.09554) is an end-to-end detector built on top of a DINOv2-style vision backbone and a lightweight DETR decoder. In this Transformers implementation, RF-DETR uses a windowed DINOv2-with-registers backbone and a Group-DETR-style decoder stack inherited from LW-DETR components for efficient object detection.

The original project is available at [roboflow/rf-detr](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr).

The example below demonstrates how to perform object detection with the [`Pipeline`] and [`AutoModelForObjectDetection`].

<hfoptions id="usage">
<hfoption id="Pipeline">

```python
from transformers import pipeline
import torch

pipe = pipeline(
    "object-detection",
    model="nielsr/rf-detr-small",
    dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map=0,
)

outputs = pipe("http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg")
print(outputs[:3])
```

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="AutoModel">

```python
from transformers import AutoImageProcessor, AutoModelForObjectDetection
from PIL import Image
import requests
import torch

url = "http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg"
image = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)

image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("nielsr/rf-detr-small")
model = AutoModelForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("nielsr/rf-detr-small")

inputs = image_processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")

with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

results = image_processor.post_process_object_detection(
    outputs,
    target_sizes=torch.tensor([image.size[::-1]]),
    threshold=0.3,
)[0]

for score, label_id, box in zip(results["scores"], results["labels"], results["boxes"]):
    score = score.item()
    label = model.config.id2label[label_id.item()]
    box = [round(i, 2) for i in box.tolist()]
    print(f"{label}: {score:.2f} {box}")
```

## Notes

- RF-DETR predicts detections from `num_queries * group_detr` query slots during training/inference (`300 * 13 = 3900` by default).
- The backbone is configured via [`~transformers.RfDetrWindowedDinov2Config`] and can be instantiated as a standalone backbone with [`~transformers.RfDetrWindowedDinov2Backbone`].
- This implementation currently exposes object detection ([`~transformers.RfDetrForObjectDetection`]) and does not yet expose a dedicated segmentation head.

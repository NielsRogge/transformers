# Gemma2

## Overview

The Gemma2 model was proposed in [Gemma2: Open Models Based on Gemini Technology and Research](https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-gemma-2/) by Gemma2 Team, Google.
Two Gemma2 models are released, with parameters sizes of 9 billion (9B) and 27 billion (27B).

The abstract from the blog post is the following:

*Now we’re officially releasing Gemma 2 to researchers and developers globally. Available in both 9 billion (9B) and 27 billion (27B) parameter sizes, Gemma 2 is higher-performing and more efficient at inference than the first generation, with significant safety advancements built in. In fact, at 27B, it offers competitive alternatives to models more than twice its size, delivering the kind of performance that was only possible with proprietary models as recently as December.*

Tips:

- The original checkpoints can be converted using the conversion script `src/transformers/models/Gemma2/convert_Gemma2_weights_to_hf.py` 

<Tip warning={true}>

- Gemma2 uses sliding window attention every second layer, which makes it unsuitable for typical kv caching with [`~DynamicCache`] or tuples of tensors. To enable caching in Gemma2 forward call, you must initialize a [`~HybridCache`] instance and pass it as `past_key_values` to the forward call. Note, that you also have to prepare `cache_position` if the `past_key_values` already contains previous keys and values.

This model was contributed by [Arthur Zucker](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ), [Pedro Cuenca](https://huggingface.co/pcuenq) and [Tom Arsen]().


## Gemma2Config


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`Gemma2Model`]. It is used to instantiate an Gemma2
    model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration with the
    defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Gemma2-7B.
    e.g. [google/gemma2-7b](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma2-7b)
    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.
    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 256000):
            Vocabulary size of the Gemma2 model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`Gemma2Model`]
        hidden_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2304):
            Dimension of the hidden representations.
        intermediate_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 9216):
            Dimension of the MLP representations.
        num_hidden_layers (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 26):
            Number of hidden layers in the Transformer decoder.
        num_attention_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 8):
            Number of attention heads for each attention layer in the Transformer decoder.
        num_key_value_heads (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 4):
            This is the number of key_value heads that should be used to implement Grouped Query Attention. If
            `num_key_value_heads=num_attention_heads`, the model will use Multi Head Attention (MHA), if
            `num_key_value_heads=1` the model will use Multi Query Attention (MQA) otherwise GQA is used. When
            converting a multi-head checkpoint to a GQA checkpoint, each group key and value head should be constructed
            by meanpooling all the original heads within that group. For more details checkout [this
            paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13245.pdf). If it is not specified, will default to
            `num_attention_heads`.
        head_dim (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 256):
            The attention head dimension.
        hidden_activation (`str` or `function`, *optional*, defaults to `"gelu_pytorch_tanh"`):
            The non-linear activation function (function or string) in the decoder. Will default to `"gelu_pytorch_tanh"`
            if not specified. `"gelu_pytorch_tanh"` uses an approximation of the `"gelu"` activation function.
        max_position_embeddings (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 8192):
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with.

            The standard deviation of the truncated_normal_initializer for initializing all weight matrices.
        rms_norm_eps (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1e-06):
            The epsilon used by the rms normalization layers.
        use_cache (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):
            Whether or not the model should return the last key/values attentions (not used by all models). Only
            relevant if `config.is_decoder=True`.
        pad_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
            Padding token id.
        eos_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1):
            End of stream token id.
        bos_token_id (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2):
            Beginning of stream token id.
        tie_word_embeddings (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `True`):

        attention_bias (`bool`, defaults to `False`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether to use a bias in the query, key, value and output projection layers during self-attention.
        attention_dropout (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.
        query_pre_attn_scalar (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 256): scaling factor used on the attention scores
        sliding_window (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 4096): in Gemma2, every other layer uses sliding window attention. This is the
            size of the sliding window.
        final_logit_softcapping (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 30.0): scaling factor when applying tanh softcapping on the logits.
        attn_logit_softcapping (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 50.0): scaling factor when applying tanh softcapping on the attention scores.
        cache_implementation (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"hybrid"`): the cache type to be used with `generate`.

## Gemma2Model

The bare Gemma2 Model outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`Gemma2Config`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    Transformer decoder consisting of *config.num_hidden_layers* layers. Each layer is a [`Gemma2DecoderLayer`]

    Args:
        config: Gemma2Config

Methods: forward

## Gemma2ForSequenceClassification


    The Gemma2 Model transformer with a sequence classification head on top (linear layer).

    [`Gemma2ForSequenceClassification`] uses the last token in order to do the classification, as other causal models
    (e.g. GPT-2) do.

    Since it does classification on the last token, it requires to know the position of the last token. If a
    `pad_token_id` is defined in the configuration, it finds the last token that is not a padding token in each row. If
    no `pad_token_id` is defined, it simply takes the last value in each row of the batch. Since it cannot guess the
    padding tokens when `inputs_embeds` are passed instead of `input_ids`, it does the same (take the last value in
    each row of the batch).
    
    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`Gemma2Config`]):
            Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model. Initializing with a config file does not
            load the weights associated with the model, only the configuration. Check out the
            [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

# PhoBERT

## Overview

The PhoBERT model was proposed in [PhoBERT: Pre-trained language models for Vietnamese](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.92.pdf) by Dat Quoc Nguyen, Anh Tuan Nguyen.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We present PhoBERT with two versions, PhoBERT-base and PhoBERT-large, the first public large-scale monolingual
language models pre-trained for Vietnamese. Experimental results show that PhoBERT consistently outperforms the recent
best pre-trained multilingual model XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) and improves the state-of-the-art in multiple
Vietnamese-specific NLP tasks including Part-of-speech tagging, Dependency parsing, Named-entity recognition and
Natural language inference.*

This model was contributed by [dqnguyen](https://huggingface.co/dqnguyen). The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/VinAIResearch/PhoBERT).

## Usage example

```python
>>> import torch
>>> from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

>>> phobert = AutoModel.from_pretrained("vinai/phobert-base")
>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("vinai/phobert-base")

>>> # INPUT TEXT MUST BE ALREADY WORD-SEGMENTED!
>>> line = "Tôi là sinh_viên trường đại_học Công_nghệ ."

>>> input_ids = torch.tensor([tokenizer.encode(line)])

>>> with torch.no_grad():
...     features = phobert(input_ids)  # Models outputs are now tuples

>>> # With TensorFlow 2.0+:
>>> # from transformers import TFAutoModel
>>> # phobert = TFAutoModel.from_pretrained("vinai/phobert-base")
```

<Tip> 

PhoBERT implementation is the same as BERT, except for tokenization. Refer to [BERT documentation](bert) for information on 
configuration classes and their parameters. PhoBERT-specific tokenizer is documented below.  

</Tip>

## PhobertTokenizer


    Construct a PhoBERT tokenizer. Based on Byte-Pair-Encoding.

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            Path to the vocabulary file.
        merges_file (`str`):
            Path to the merges file.
        bos_token (`st`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
            sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

            </Tip>

        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.
            The token used is the `sep_token`.

            </Tip>

        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<mask>"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.

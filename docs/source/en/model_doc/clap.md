# CLAP

## Overview

The CLAP model was proposed in [Large Scale Contrastive Language-Audio pretraining with
feature fusion and keyword-to-caption augmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.06687.pdf) by Yusong Wu, Ke Chen, Tianyu Zhang, Yuchen Hui, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Shlomo Dubnov.

CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) is a neural network trained on a variety of (audio, text) pairs. It can be instructed in to predict the most relevant text snippet, given an audio, without directly optimizing for the task. The CLAP model uses a SWINTransformer to get audio features from a log-Mel spectrogram input, and a RoBERTa model to get text features. Both the text and audio features are then projected to a latent space with identical dimension. The dot product between the projected audio and text features is then used as a similar score.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Contrastive learning has shown remarkable success in the field of multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we propose a pipeline of contrastive language-audio pretraining to develop an audio representation by combining audio data with natural language descriptions. To accomplish this target, we first release LAION-Audio-630K, a large collection of 633,526 audio-text pairs from different data sources. Second, we construct a contrastive language-audio pretraining model by considering different audio encoders and text encoders. We incorporate the feature fusion mechanism and keyword-to-caption augmentation into the model design to further enable the model to process audio inputs of variable lengths and enhance the performance. Third, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate our model across three tasks: text-to-audio retrieval, zero-shot audio classification, and supervised audio classification. The results demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance in text-to-audio retrieval task. In audio classification tasks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the zeroshot setting and is able to obtain performance comparable to models' results in the non-zero-shot setting. LAION-Audio-6*

## ClapConfig


    [`ClapConfig`] is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`ClapModel`]. It is used to instantiate
    a CLAP model according to the specified arguments, defining the text model and audio model configs. Instantiating a
    configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the CLAP
    [laion/clap-htsat-fused](https://huggingface.co/laion/clap-htsat-fused) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    >>> # Initializing a ClapModel (with random weights) from the laion-ai/base style configuration
    >>> model = ClapModel(configuration)

## ClapFeatureExtractor


    Constructs a CLAP feature extractor.

    This feature extractor inherits from [`~feature_extraction_sequence_utils.SequenceFeatureExtractor`] which contains
    most of the main methods. Users should refer to this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    This class extracts mel-filter bank features from raw speech using a custom numpy implementation of the *Short Time
    Fourier Transform* (STFT) which should match pytorch's `torch.stft` equivalent.

    Args:
        feature_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 64):
            The feature dimension of the extracted Mel spectrograms. This corresponds to the number of mel filters
            (`n_mels`).
        sampling_rate (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 48000):
            The sampling rate at which the audio files should be digitalized expressed in hertz (Hz). This only serves
            to warn users if the audio fed to the feature extractor does not have the same sampling rate.
        hop_length (`int`,*optional*, defaults to 480):
            Length of the overlaping windows for the STFT used to obtain the Mel Spectrogram. The audio will be split
            in smaller `frames` with a step of `hop_length` between each frame.
        max_length_s (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 10):
            The maximum input length of the model in seconds. This is used to pad the audio.
        fft_window_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 1024):
            Size of the window (in samples) on which the Fourier transform is applied. This controls the frequency
            resolution of the spectrogram. 400 means that the fourrier transform is computed on windows of 400 samples.
        padding_value (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.0):
            Padding value used to pad the audio. Should correspond to silences.
        return_attention_mask (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not the model should return the attention masks coresponding to the input.
        frequency_min (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0):
            The lowest frequency of interest. The STFT will not be computed for values below this.
        frequency_max (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 14000):
            The highest frequency of interest. The STFT will not be computed for values above this.
        top_db (`float`, *optional*):
            The highest decibel value used to convert the mel spectrogram to the log scale. For more details see the
            `audio_utils.power_to_db` function
        truncation (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"fusion"`):
            Truncation pattern for long audio inputs. Two patterns are available:
                - `fusion` will use `_random_mel_fusion`, which stacks 3 random crops from the mel spectrogram and a
                  downsampled version of the entire mel spectrogram.
            If `config.fusion` is set to True, shorter audios also need to to return 4 mels, which will just be a copy
            of the original mel obtained from the padded audio.
                - `rand_trunc` will select a random crop of the mel spectrogram.
        padding (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"repeatpad"`):
               Padding pattern for shorter audio inputs. Three patterns were originally implemented:
                - `repeatpad`: the audio is repeated, and then padded to fit the `max_length`.
                - `repeat`: the audio is repeated and then cut to fit the `max_length`
                - `pad`: the audio is padded.
    

## ClapProcessor


    Constructs a CLAP processor which wraps a CLAP feature extractor and a RoBerta tokenizer into a single processor.

    [`ClapProcessor`] offers all the functionalities of [`ClapFeatureExtractor`] and [`RobertaTokenizerFast`]. See the
    [`~ClapProcessor.__call__`] and [`~ClapProcessor.decode`] for more information.

    Args:
        feature_extractor ([`ClapFeatureExtractor`]):
            The audio processor is a required input.
        tokenizer ([`RobertaTokenizerFast`]):
            The tokenizer is a required input.
    

## ClapModel


    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`ClapConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.

    - get_audio_features

## ClapTextModel



    The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
    cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in *Attention is
    all you need*_ by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz
    Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

    To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set
    to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and
    `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

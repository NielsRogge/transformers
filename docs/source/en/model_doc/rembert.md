# RemBERT

## Overview

The RemBERT model was proposed in [Rethinking Embedding Coupling in Pre-trained Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12821) by Hyung Won Chung, Thibault Févry, Henry Tsai, Melvin Johnson, Sebastian Ruder.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We re-evaluate the standard practice of sharing weights between input and output embeddings in state-of-the-art
pre-trained language models. We show that decoupled embeddings provide increased modeling flexibility, allowing us to
significantly improve the efficiency of parameter allocation in the input embedding of multilingual models. By
reallocating the input embedding parameters in the Transformer layers, we achieve dramatically better performance on
standard natural language understanding tasks with the same number of parameters during fine-tuning. We also show that
allocating additional capacity to the output embedding provides benefits to the model that persist through the
fine-tuning stage even though the output embedding is discarded after pre-training. Our analysis shows that larger
output embeddings prevent the model's last layers from overspecializing to the pre-training task and encourage
Transformer representations to be more general and more transferable to other tasks and languages. Harnessing these
findings, we are able to train models that achieve strong performance on the XTREME benchmark without increasing the
number of parameters at the fine-tuning stage.*

## Usage tips

For fine-tuning, RemBERT can be thought of as a bigger version of mBERT with an ALBERT-like factorization of the
embedding layer. The embeddings are not tied in pre-training, in contrast with BERT, which enables smaller input
embeddings (preserved during fine-tuning) and bigger output embeddings (discarded at fine-tuning). The tokenizer is
also similar to the Albert one rather than the BERT one.

## RemBertConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`RemBertModel`]. It is used to instantiate an
    RemBERT model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a configuration
    with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the RemBERT
    [google/rembert](https://huggingface.co/google/rembert) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 250300):
            Vocabulary size of the RemBERT model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the
            `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`RemBertModel`] or [`TFRemBertModel`]. Vocabulary size of the model.
            Defines the different tokens that can be represented by the *inputs_ids* passed to the forward method of

            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[CLS]"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"[MASK]"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language

## RemBertModel

The bare RemBERT Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.
    This model is a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) sub-class. Use
    it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage and
    behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`RemBertConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the model.
            Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.


    The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
    cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in [Attention is
    all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit,
    Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

    To behave as an decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set
    to `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and
    `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

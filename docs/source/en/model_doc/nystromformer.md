# Nyströmformer

## Overview

The Nyströmformer model was proposed in [*Nyströmformer: A Nyström-Based Algorithm for Approximating Self-Attention*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902) by Yunyang Xiong, Zhanpeng Zeng, Rudrasis Chakraborty, Mingxing Tan, Glenn
Fung, Yin Li, and Vikas Singh.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component
that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or
dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the
input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences -- a topic being actively studied in the
community. To address this limitation, we propose Nyströmformer -- a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a
function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nyström method to approximate standard self-attention
with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nyströmformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of
tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard
sequence length, and find that our Nyströmformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than
standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nyströmformer performs
favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods. Our code is available at this https URL.*

## NystromformerConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`NystromformerModel`]. It is used to instantiate
    an Nystromformer model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture. Instantiating a
    configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Nystromformer
    [uw-madison/nystromformer-512](https://huggingface.co/uw-madison/nystromformer-512) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

    Args:
        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 30000):
            Vocabulary size of the Nystromformer model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented
            by the `inputs_ids` passed when calling [`NystromformerModel`].

            Dimension of the encoder layers and the pooler layer.

        hidden_act (`str` or `function`, *optional*, defaults to `"gelu"`):
            The non-linear activation function (function or string) in the encoder and pooler. If string, `"gelu"`,
            `"relu"`, `"selu"` and `"gelu_new"` are supported.
        hidden_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):
            The dropout probability for all fully connected layers in the embeddings, encoder, and pooler.
        attention_probs_dropout_prob (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.1):
            The dropout ratio for the attention probabilities.
        max_position_embeddings (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 512):
            The maximum sequence length that this model might ever be used with. Typically set this to something large
            just in case (e.g., 512 or 1024 or 2048).
        type_vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 2):

            matrix.
        conv_kernel_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 65):
            The kernel size of depthwise convolution used in Nystrom approximation.
        inv_coeff_init_option (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to use exact coefficient computation for the initial values for the iterative method of
            calculating the Moore-Penrose inverse of a matrix.

    >>> model = NystromformerModel(configuration)

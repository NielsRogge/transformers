# CamemBERT

## Overview

The CamemBERT model was proposed in [CamemBERT: a Tasty French Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03894) by
[Louis Martin](https://huggingface.co/louismartin), [Benjamin Muller](https://huggingface.co/benjamin-mlr), [Pedro Javier Ortiz Suárez](https://huggingface.co/pjox), Yoann Dupont, Laurent Romary, Éric Villemonte de la
Clergerie, [Djamé Seddah](https://huggingface.co/Djame), and [Benoît Sagot](https://huggingface.co/sagot). It is based on Facebook's RoBERTa model released in 2019. It is a model
trained on 138GB of French text.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*Pretrained language models are now ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing. Despite their success, most available
models have either been trained on English data or on the concatenation of data in multiple languages. This makes
practical use of such models --in all languages except English-- very limited. Aiming to address this issue for French,
we release CamemBERT, a French version of the Bi-directional Encoders for Transformers (BERT). We measure the
performance of CamemBERT compared to multilingual models in multiple downstream tasks, namely part-of-speech tagging,
dependency parsing, named-entity recognition, and natural language inference. CamemBERT improves the state of the art
for most of the tasks considered. We release the pretrained model for CamemBERT hoping to foster research and
downstream applications for French NLP.*

This model was contributed by [the ALMAnaCH team (Inria)](https://huggingface.co/almanach). The original code can be found [here](https://camembert-model.fr/).

<Tip>

This implementation is the same as RoBERTa. Refer to the [documentation of RoBERTa](roberta) for usage examples as well 
as the information relative to the inputs and outputs.

## CamembertConfig


    This is the configuration class to store the configuration of a [`CamembertModel`] or a [`TFCamembertModel`]. It is
    used to instantiate a Camembert model according to the specified arguments, defining the model architecture.
    Instantiating a configuration with the defaults will yield a similar configuration to that of the Camembert
    [almanach/camembert-base](https://huggingface.co/almanach/camembert-base) architecture.

    Configuration objects inherit from [`PretrainedConfig`] and can be used to control the model outputs. Read the
    documentation from [`PretrainedConfig`] for more information.

        vocab_size (`int`, *optional*, defaults to 30522):
            Vocabulary size of the BERT model. Defines the number of different tokens that can be represented by the

    >>> model = CamembertModel(configuration)

    >>> # Accessing the model configuration
    >>> configuration = model.config
    ```

## CamembertTokenizer


    Adapted from [`RobertaTokenizer`] and [`XLNetTokenizer`]. Construct a CamemBERT tokenizer. Based on
    [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece).

    This tokenizer inherits from [`PreTrainedTokenizer`] which contains most of the main methods. Users should refer to
    this superclass for more information regarding those methods.

    Args:
        vocab_file (`str`):
            [SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) file (generally has a *.spm* extension) that
            contains the vocabulary necessary to instantiate a tokenizer.
        bos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The beginning of sequence token that was used during pretraining. Can be used a sequence classifier token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the beginning of
            sequence. The token used is the `cls_token`.

            </Tip>

        eos_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The end of sequence token.

            <Tip>

            When building a sequence using special tokens, this is not the token that is used for the end of sequence.
            The token used is the `sep_token`.

            </Tip>

        sep_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"</s>"`):
            The separator token, which is used when building a sequence from multiple sequences, e.g. two sequences for
            sequence classification or for a text and a question for question answering. It is also used as the last
            token of a sequence built with special tokens.
        cls_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<s>"`):
            The classifier token which is used when doing sequence classification (classification of the whole sequence
            instead of per-token classification). It is the first token of the sequence when built with special tokens.
        unk_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<unk>"`):
            The unknown token. A token that is not in the vocabulary cannot be converted to an ID and is set to be this
            token instead.
        pad_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<pad>"`):
            The token used for padding, for example when batching sequences of different lengths.
        mask_token (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"<mask>"`):
            The token used for masking values. This is the token used when training this model with masked language
            modeling. This is the token which the model will try to predict.

            Will be passed to the `SentencePieceProcessor.__init__()` method. The [Python wrapper for
            SentencePiece](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece/tree/master/python) can be used, among other things,
            to set:

            - `enable_sampling`: Enable subword regularization.
            - `nbest_size`: Sampling parameters for unigram. Invalid for BPE-Dropout.

              - `nbest_size = {0,1}`: No sampling is performed.
              - `nbest_size > 1`: samples from the nbest_size results.
              - `nbest_size < 0`: assuming that nbest_size is infinite and samples from the all hypothesis (lattice)
                using forward-filtering-and-backward-sampling algorithm.

            - `alpha`: Smoothing parameter for unigram sampling, and dropout probability of merge operations for
              BPE-dropout.

    Attributes:
        sp_model (`SentencePieceProcessor`):
            The *SentencePiece* processor that is used for every conversion (string, tokens and IDs).

## CamembertModel

The bare CamemBERT Model transformer outputting raw hidden-states without any specific head on top.

    This model inherits from [`PreTrainedModel`]. Check the superclass documentation for the generic methods the
    library implements for all its model (such as downloading or saving, resizing the input embeddings, pruning heads
    etc.)

    This model is also a PyTorch [torch.nn.Module](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Module) subclass.
    Use it as a regular PyTorch Module and refer to the PyTorch documentation for all matter related to general usage
    and behavior.

    Parameters:
        config ([`CamembertConfig`]): Model configuration class with all the parameters of the
            model. Initializing with a config file does not load the weights associated with the model, only the
            configuration. Check out the [`~PreTrainedModel.from_pretrained`] method to load the model weights.


    The model can behave as an encoder (with only self-attention) as well as a decoder, in which case a layer of
    cross-attention is added between the self-attention layers, following the architecture described in *Attention is
    all you need*_ by Ashish Vaswani, Noam Shazeer, Niki Parmar, Jakob Uszkoreit, Llion Jones, Aidan N. Gomez, Lukasz
    Kaiser and Illia Polosukhin.

    To behave as a decoder the model needs to be initialized with the `is_decoder` argument of the configuration set to
    `True`. To be used in a Seq2Seq model, the model needs to initialized with both `is_decoder` argument and
    `add_cross_attention` set to `True`; an `encoder_hidden_states` is then expected as an input to the forward pass.

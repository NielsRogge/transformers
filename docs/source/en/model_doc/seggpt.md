# SegGPT

## Overview

The SegGPT model was proposed in [SegGPT: Segmenting Everything In Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03284) by Xinlong Wang, Xiaosong Zhang, Yue Cao, Wen Wang, Chunhua Shen, Tiejun Huang. SegGPT employs a decoder-only Transformer that can generate a segmentation mask given an input image, a prompt image and its corresponding prompt mask. The model achieves remarkable one-shot results with 56.1 mIoU on COCO-20 and 85.6 mIoU on FSS-1000.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We present SegGPT, a generalist model for segmenting everything in context. We unify various segmentation tasks into a generalist in-context learning framework that accommodates different kinds of segmentation data by transforming them into the same format of images. The training of SegGPT is formulated as an in-context coloring problem with random color mapping for each data sample. The objective is to accomplish diverse tasks according to the context, rather than relying on specific colors. After training, SegGPT can perform arbitrary segmentation tasks in images or videos via in-context inference, such as object instance, stuff, part, contour, and text. SegGPT is evaluated on a broad range of tasks, including few-shot semantic segmentation, video object segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. Our results show strong capabilities in segmenting in-domain and out-of*

Tips:
- One can use [`SegGptImageProcessor`] to prepare image input, prompt and mask to the model.
